CHAPTER I. I GO TO STYLES\
\
The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the\
time as \'93The Styles Case\'94 has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless, in\
view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it, I have been asked,\
both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves, to write an account\
of the whole story. This, we trust, will effectually silence the\
sensational rumours which still persist.\
\
I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my\
being connected with the affair.\
\
I had been invalided home from the Front; and, after spending some\
months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home, was given a month\'92s\
sick leave. Having no near relations or friends, I was trying to make\
up my mind what to do, when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen\
very little of him for some years. Indeed, I had never known him\
particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one\
thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy, though,\
I had often stayed at Styles, his mother\'92s place in Essex.\
\
We had a good yarn about old times, and it ended in his inviting me\
down to Styles to spend my leave there.\
\
\'93The mater will be delighted to see you again\'97after all those years,\'94\
he added.\
\
\'93Your mother keeps well?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Oh, yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?\'94\
\
I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish, who\
had married John\'92s father when he was a widower with two sons, had been\
a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could\
not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic,\
autocratic personality, somewhat inclined to charitable and social\
notoriety, with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady\
Bountiful. She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable\
fortune of her own.\
\
Their country-place, Styles Court, had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish\
early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife\'92s\
ascendancy, so much so that, on dying, he left the place to her for her\
lifetime, as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that\
was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother, however, had\
always been most generous to them; indeed, they were so young at the\
time of their father\'92s remarriage that they always thought of her as\
their own mother.\
\
Lawrence, the younger, had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a\
doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine, and lived at\
home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any\
marked success.\
\
John practised for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled\
down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two\
years ago, and had taken his wife to live at Styles, though I\
entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother\
to increase his allowance, which would have enabled him to have a home\
of his own. Mrs. Cavendish, however, was a lady who liked to make her\
own plans, and expected other people to fall in with them, and in this\
case she certainly had the whip hand, namely: the purse strings.\
\
John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother\'92s remarriage and\
smiled rather ruefully.\
\
\'93Rotten little bounder too!\'94 he said savagely. \'93I can tell you,\
Hastings, it\'92s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie\'97you\
remember Evie?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I suppose she was after your time. She\'92s the mater\'92s factotum,\
companion, Jack of all trades! A great sport\'97old Evie! Not precisely\
young and beautiful, but as game as they make them.\'94\
\
\'93You were going to say\'97\'97?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, this fellow! He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a\
second cousin or something of Evie\'92s, though she didn\'92t seem\
particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an\
absolute outsider, anyone can see that. He\'92s got a great black beard,\
and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned\
to him at once, took him on as secretary\'97you know how she\'92s always\
running a hundred societies?\'94\
\
I nodded.\
\
\'93Well, of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No\
doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us\
all down with a feather when, three months ago, she suddenly announced\
that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty\
years younger than she is! It\'92s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but\
there you are\'97she is her own mistress, and she\'92s married him.\'94\
\
\'93It must be a difficult situation for you all.\'94\
\
\'93Difficult! It\'92s damnable!\'94\
\
Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train\
at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason\
for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country\
lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out\
to the car.\
\
\'93Got a drop or two of petrol still, you see,\'94 he remarked. \'93Mainly\
owing to the mater\'92s activities.\'94\
\
The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the\
little station, and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It\
was a still, warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat\
Essex country, lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun, it\
seemed almost impossible to believe that, not so very far away, a great\
war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed\
into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said:\
\
\'93I\'92m afraid you\'92ll find it very quiet down here, Hastings.\'94\
\
\'93My dear fellow, that\'92s just what I want.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, it\'92s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill\
with the volunteers twice a week, and lend a hand at the farms. My wife\
works regularly \'91on the land\'92. She is up at five every morning to milk,\
and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It\'92s a jolly good life taking\
it all round\'97if it weren\'92t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp!\'94 He\
checked the car suddenly, and glanced at his watch. \'93I wonder if we\'92ve\
time to pick up Cynthia. No, she\'92ll have started from the hospital by\
now.\'94\
\
\'93Cynthia! That\'92s not your wife?\'94\
\
\'93No, Cynthia is a prot\'e9g\'e9e of my mother\'92s, the daughter of an old\
schoolfellow of hers, who married a rascally solicitor. He came a\
cropper, and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came\
to the rescue, and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She\
works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster, seven miles away.\'94\
\
As he spoke the last words, we drew up in front of the fine old house.\
A lady in a stout tweed skirt, who was bending over a flower bed,\
straightened herself at our approach.\
\
\'93Hullo, Evie, here\'92s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings\'97Miss Howard.\'94\
\
Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty, almost painful, grip. I had an\
impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a\
pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly\
in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with\
feet to match\'97these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation,\
I soon found, was couched in the telegraphic style.\
\
\'93Weeds grow like house afire. Can\'92t keep even with \'92em. Shall press you\
in. Better be careful.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful,\'94 I\
responded.\
\
\'93Don\'92t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn\'92t later.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92re a cynic, Evie,\'94 said John, laughing. \'93Where\'92s tea to-day\'97inside\
or out?\'94\
\
\'93Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.\'94\
\
\'93Come on then, you\'92ve done enough gardening for to-day. \'91The labourer\
is worthy of his hire\'92, you know. Come and be refreshed.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Miss Howard, drawing off her gardening gloves, \'93I\'92m\
inclined to agree with you.\'94\
\
She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade\
of a large sycamore.\
\
A figure rose from one of the basket chairs, and came a few steps to\
meet us.\
\
\'93My wife, Hastings,\'94 said John.\
\
I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall,\
slender form, outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of\
slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful\
tawny eyes of hers, remarkable eyes, different from any other woman\'92s\
that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed,\
which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in\
an exquisitely civilised body\'97all these things are burnt into my\
memory. I shall never forget them.\
\
She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear\
voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I\
had accepted John\'92s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea, and\
her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a\
thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always\
stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents\
of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly\
amused my hostess. John, of course, good fellow though he is, could\
hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.\
\
At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French\
window near at hand:\
\
\'93Then you\'92ll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I\'92ll write to\
Lady Tadminster for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we\
hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might\
open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there\'92s the\
Duchess\'97about the school f\'eate.\'94\
\
There was the murmur of a man\'92s voice, and then Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s rose\
in reply:\
\
\'93Yes, certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful,\
Alfred dear.\'94\
\
The French window swung open a little wider, and a handsome\
white-haired old lady, with a somewhat masterful cast of features,\
stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her, a suggestion of\
deference in his manner.\
\
Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.\
\
\'93Why, if it isn\'92t too delightful to see you again, Mr. Hastings, after\
all these years. Alfred, darling, Mr. Hastings\'97my husband.\'94\
\
I looked with some curiosity at \'93Alfred darling\'94. He certainly struck a\
rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It\
was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore\
gold-rimmed pince-nez, and had a curious impassivity of feature. It\
struck me that he might look natural on a stage, but was strangely out\
of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He\
placed a wooden hand in mine and said:\
\
\'93This is a pleasure, Mr. Hastings.\'94 Then, turning to his wife: \'93Emily\
dearest, I think that cushion is a little damp.\'94\
\
She beamed fondly on him, as he substituted another with every\
demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an\
otherwise sensible woman!\
\
With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp, a sense of constraint and veiled\
hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard, in\
particular, took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp,\
however, seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility, which I\
remembered of old, had lost nothing in the intervening years, and she\
poured out a steady flood of conversation, mainly on the subject of the\
forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place\
shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of\
days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the\
very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter\
myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.\
\
Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about\
letters to Evelyn Howard, and her husband addressed me in his\
painstaking voice:\
\
\'93Is soldiering your regular profession, Mr. Hastings?\'94\
\
\'93No, before the war I was in Lloyd\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93And you will return there after it is over?\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.\'94\
\
Mary Cavendish leant forward.\
\
\'93What would you really choose as a profession, if you could just\
consult your inclination?\'94\
\
\'93Well, that depends.\'94\
\
\'93No secret hobby?\'94 she asked. \'93Tell me\'97you\'92re drawn to something?\
Everyone is\'97usually something absurd.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ll laugh at me.\'94\
\
She smiled.\
\
\'93Perhaps.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I\'92ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!\'94\
\
\'93The real thing\'97Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really, seriously, I am awfully\
drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once, a very famous\
detective, and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow.\
He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of\
method. My system is based on his\'97though of course I have progressed\
rather further. He was a funny little man, a great dandy, but\
wonderfully clever.\'94\
\
\'93Like a good detective story myself,\'94 remarked Miss Howard. \'93Lots of\
nonsense written, though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone\
dumbfounded. Real crime\'97you\'92d know at once.\'94\
\
\'93There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes,\'94 I argued.\
\
\'93Don\'92t mean the police, but the people that are right in it. The\
family. You couldn\'92t really hoodwink them. They\'92d know.\'94\
\
\'93Then,\'94 I said, much amused, \'93you think that if you were mixed up in a\
crime, say a murder, you\'92d be able to spot the murderer right off?\'94\
\
\'93Of course I should. Mightn\'92t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers.\
But I\'92m certain I\'92d know. I\'92d feel it in my fingertips if he came near\
me.\'94\
\
\'93It might be a \'91she\'92,\'94 I suggested.\
\
\'93Might. But murder\'92s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.\'94\
\
\'93Not in a case of poisoning.\'94 Mrs. Cavendish\'92s clear voice startled me.\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that, owing to the general\
ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession,\
there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.\'94\
\
\'93Why, Mary, what a gruesome conversation!\'94 cried Mrs. Inglethorp. \'93It\
makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh, there\'92s\
Cynthia!\'94\
\
A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.\
\
\'93Why, Cynthia, you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings\'97Miss Murdoch.\'94\
\
Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature, full of life and\
vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap, and I admired the great\
loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the\
hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she\
would have been a beauty.\
\
She flung herself down on the ground beside John, and as I handed her a\
plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.\
\
\'93Sit down here on the grass, do. It\'92s ever so much nicer.\'94\
\
I dropped down obediently.\
\
\'93You work at Tadminster, don\'92t you, Miss Murdoch?\'94\
\
She nodded.\
\
\'93For my sins.\'94\
\
\'93Do they bully you, then?\'94 I asked, smiling.\
\
\'93I should like to see them!\'94 cried Cynthia with dignity.\
\
\'93I have got a cousin who is nursing,\'94 I remarked. \'93And she is terrified\
of \'91Sisters\'92.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t wonder. Sisters _are_, you know, Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly\
_are_! You\'92ve no idea! But I\'92m not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the\
dispensary.\'94\
\
\'93How many people do you poison?\'94 I asked, smiling.\
\
Cynthia smiled too.\
\
\'93Oh, hundreds!\'94 she said.\
\
\'93Cynthia,\'94 called Mrs. Inglethorp, \'93do you think you could write a few\
notes for me?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, Aunt Emily.\'94\
\
She jumped up promptly, and something in her manner reminded me that\
her position was a dependent one, and that Mrs. Inglethorp, kind as she\
might be in the main, did not allow her to forget it.\
\
My hostess turned to me.\
\
\'93John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have\
given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster, our Member\'92s\
wife\'97she was the late Lord Abbotsbury\'92s daughter\'97does the same. She\
agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a\
war household; nothing is wasted here\'97every scrap of waste paper, even,\
is saved and sent away in sacks.\'94\
\
I expressed my appreciation, and John took me into the house and up the\
broad staircase, which forked right and left half-way to different\
wings of the building. My room was in the left wing, and looked out\
over the park.\
\
John left me, and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking\
slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs.\
Inglethorp call \'93Cynthia\'94 impatiently, and the girl started and ran\
back to the house. At the same moment, a man stepped out from the\
shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked\
about forty, very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some\
violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window\
as he passed, and I recognized him, though he had changed much in the\
fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John\'92s younger\
brother, Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought\
that singular expression to his face.\
\
Then I dismissed him from my mind, and returned to the contemplation of\
my own affairs.\
\
The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that\
enigmatical woman, Mary Cavendish.\
\
The next morning dawned bright and sunny, and I was full of the\
anticipation of a delightful visit.\
\
I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time, when she volunteered to\
take me for a walk, and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the\
woods, returning to the house about five.\
\
As we entered the large hall, John beckoned us both into the\
smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had\
occurred. We followed him in, and he shut the door after us.\
\
\'93Look here, Mary, there\'92s the deuce of a mess. Evie\'92s had a row with\
Alfred Inglethorp, and she\'92s off.\'94\
\
\'93Evie? Off?\'94\
\
John nodded gloomily.\
\
\'93Yes; you see she went to the mater, and\'97Oh,\'97here\'92s Evie herself.\'94\
\
Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together, and she carried\
a small suit-case. She looked excited and determined, and slightly on\
the defensive.\
\
\'93At any rate,\'94 she burst out, \'93I\'92ve spoken my mind!\'94\
\
\'93My dear Evelyn,\'94 cried Mrs. Cavendish, \'93this can\'92t be true!\'94\
\
Miss Howard nodded grimly.\
\
\'93True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won\'92t forget or\
forgive in a hurry. Don\'92t mind if they\'92ve only sunk in a bit. Probably\
water off a duck\'92s back, though. I said right out: \'91You\'92re an old\
woman, Emily, and there\'92s no fool like an old fool. The man\'92s twenty\
years younger than you, and don\'92t you fool yourself as to what he\
married you for. Money! Well, don\'92t let him have too much of it. Farmer\
Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much\
time he spends over there.\'92 She was very angry. Natural! I went on,\
\'91I\'92m going to warn you, whether you like it or not. That man would as\
soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He\'92s a bad lot. You can say\
what you like to me, but remember what I\'92ve told you. He\'92s a bad lot!\'92\'94\
\
\'93What did she say?\'94\
\
Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.\
\
\'93\'91Darling Alfred\'92\'97\'91dearest Alfred\'92\'97\'91wicked calumnies\'92 \'97\'91wicked\
lies\'92\'97\'91wicked woman\'92\'97to accuse her \'91dear husband!\'92 The sooner I left\
her house the better. So I\'92m off.\'94\
\
\'93But not now?\'94\
\
\'93This minute!\'94\
\
For a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish, finding\
his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains. His wife\
followed him, murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to\
think better of it.\
\
As she left the room, Miss Howard\'92s face changed. She leant towards me\
eagerly.\
\
\'93Mr. Hastings, you\'92re honest. I can trust you?\'94\
\
I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm, and sank her\
voice to a whisper.\
\
\'93Look after her, Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They\'92re a lot of\
sharks\'97all of them. Oh, I know what I\'92m talking about. There isn\'92t one\
of them that\'92s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I\'92ve\
protected her as much as I could. Now I\'92m out of the way, they\'92ll\
impose upon her.\'94\
\
\'93Of course, Miss Howard,\'94 I said, \'93I\'92ll do everything I can, but I\'92m\
sure you\'92re excited and overwrought.\'94\
\
She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.\
\
\'93Young man, trust me. I\'92ve lived in the world rather longer than you\
have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You\'92ll see what I mean.\'94\
\
The throb of the motor came through the open window, and Miss Howard\
rose and moved to the door. John\'92s voice sounded outside. With her hand\
on the handle, she turned her head over her shoulder, and beckoned to\
me.\
\
\'93Above all, Mr. Hastings, watch that devil\'97her husband!\'94\
\
There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager\
chorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.\
\
As the motor drove away, Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from\
the group, and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall\
bearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour\
rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.\
\
\'93Who is that?\'94 I asked sharply, for instinctively I distrusted the man.\
\
\'93That\'92s Dr. Bauerstein,\'94 said John shortly.\
\
\'93And who is Dr. Bauerstein?\'94\
\
\'93He\'92s staying in the village doing a rest cure, after a bad nervous\
breakdown. He\'92s a London specialist; a very clever man\'97one of the\
greatest living experts on poisons, I believe.\'94\
\
\'93And he\'92s a great friend of Mary\'92s,\'94 put in Cynthia, the irrepressible.\
\
John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.\
\
\'93Come for a stroll, Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She\
always had a rough tongue, but there is no stauncher friend in England\
than Evelyn Howard.\'94\
\
He took the path through the plantation, and we walked down to the\
village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.\
\
As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again, a pretty\
young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and\
smiled.\
\
\'93That\'92s a pretty girl,\'94 I remarked appreciatively.\
\
John\'92s face hardened.\
\
\'93That is Mrs. Raikes.\'94\
\
\'93The one that Miss Howard\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said John, with rather unnecessary abruptness.\
\
I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house, and that vivid\
wicked little face that had just smiled into ours, and a vague chill of\
foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.\
\
\'93Styles is really a glorious old place,\'94 I said to John.\
\
He nodded rather gloomily.\
\
\'93Yes, it\'92s a fine property. It\'92ll be mine some day\'97should be mine now\
by rights, if my father had only made a decent will. And then I\
shouldn\'92t be so damned hard up as I am now.\'94\
\
\'93Hard up, are you?\'94\
\
\'93My dear Hastings, I don\'92t mind telling you that I\'92m at my wits\'92 end\
for money.\'94\
\
\'93Couldn\'92t your brother help you?\'94\
\
\'93Lawrence? He\'92s gone through every penny he ever had, publishing rotten\
verses in fancy bindings. No, we\'92re an impecunious lot. My mother\'92s\
always been awfully good to us, I must say. That is, up to now. Since\
her marriage, of course\'97\'97\'94 he broke off, frowning.\
\
For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something\
indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt\
security. Now that security was removed\'97and the air seemed rife with\
suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me\
unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my\
mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II. THE 16TH AND 17TH OF JULY\
\
I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July. I come now to the events of\
the 16th and 17th of that month. For the convenience of the reader I\
will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as\
possible. They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of\
long and tedious cross-examinations.\
\
I received a letter from Evelyn Howard a couple of days after her\
departure, telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in\
Middlingham, a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away, and begging\
me to let her know if Mrs. Inglethorp should show any wish to be\
reconciled.\
\
The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was Mrs. Cavendish\'92s\
extraordinary, and, for my part, unaccountable preference for the\
society of Dr. Bauerstein. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine,\
but she was always asking him up to the house, and often went off for\
long expeditions with him. I must confess that I was quite unable to\
see his attraction.\
\
The 16th of July fell on a Monday. It was a day of turmoil. The famous\
bazaar had taken place on Saturday, and an entertainment, in connection\
with the same charity, at which Mrs. Inglethorp was to recite a War\
poem, was to be held that night. We were all busy during the morning\
arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take\
place. We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the\
garden. I noticed that John\'92s manner was somewhat unusual. He seemed\
very excited and restless.\
\
After tea, Mrs. Inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts\
in the evening and I challenged Mary Cavendish to a single at tennis.\
\
About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be\
late as supper was early that night. We had rather a scramble to get\
ready in time; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at\
the door.\
\
The entertainment was a great success, Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s recitation\
receiving tremendous applause. There were also some tableaux in which\
Cynthia took part. She did not return with us, having been asked to a\
supper party, and to remain the night with some friends who had been\
acting with her in the tableaux.\
\
The following morning, Mrs. Inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast, as\
she was rather overtired; but she appeared in her briskest mood about\
12.30, and swept Lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party.\
\
\'93Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston. Lady Tadminster\'92s\
sister, you know. The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror\'97one of\
our oldest families.\'94\
\
Mary had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with Dr.\
Bauerstein.\
\
We had a pleasant luncheon, and as we drove away Lawrence suggested\
that we should return by Tadminster, which was barely a mile out of our\
way, and pay a visit to Cynthia in her dispensary. Mrs. Inglethorp\
replied that this was an excellent idea, but as she had several letters\
to write she would drop us there, and we could come back with Cynthia\
in the pony-trap.\
\
We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter, until Cynthia\
appeared to vouch for us, looking very cool and sweet in her long white\
overall. She took us up to her sanctum, and introduced us to her fellow\
dispenser, a rather awe-inspiring individual, whom Cynthia cheerily\
addressed as \'93Nibs.\'94\
\
\'93What a lot of bottles!\'94 I exclaimed, as my eye travelled round the\
small room. \'93Do you really know what\'92s in them all?\'94\
\
\'93Say something original,\'94 groaned Cynthia. \'93Every single person who\
comes up here says that. We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on\
the first individual who does _not_ say: \'91What a lot of bottles!\'92 And I\
know the next thing you\'92re going to say is: \'91How many people have you\
poisoned?\'92\'94\
\
I pleaded guilty with a laugh.\
\
\'93If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by\
mistake, you wouldn\'92t joke about it. Come on, let\'92s have tea. We\'92ve got\
all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard. No, Lawrence\'97that\'92s the\
poison cupboard. The big cupboard\'97that\'92s right.\'94\
\
We had a very cheery tea, and assisted Cynthia to wash up afterwards.\
We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.\
The countenances of Cynthia and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a\
stern and forbidding expression.\
\
\'93Come in,\'94 said Cynthia, in a sharp professional tone.\
\
A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which\
she proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat\
enigmatical remark:\
\
\'93_I_\'92m not really here to-day.\'94\
\
Cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge.\
\
\'93This should have been sent up this morning.\'94\
\
\'93Sister is very sorry. She forgot.\'94\
\
\'93Sister should read the rules outside the door.\'94\
\
I gathered from the little nurse\'92s expression that there was not the\
least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to\
the dreaded \'93Sister\'94.\
\
\'93So now it can\'92t be done until to-morrow,\'94 finished Cynthia.\
\
\'93Don\'92t you think you could possibly let us have it to-night?\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Cynthia graciously, \'93we are very busy, but if we have time\
it shall be done.\'94\
\
The little nurse withdrew, and Cynthia promptly took a jar from the\
shelf, refilled the bottle, and placed it on the table outside the\
door.\
\
I laughed.\
\
\'93Discipline must be maintained?\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. Come out on our little balcony. You can see all the outside\
wards there.\'94\
\
I followed Cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different\
wards to me. Lawrence remained behind, but after a few moments Cynthia\
called to him over her shoulder to come and join us. Then she looked at\
her watch.\
\
\'93Nothing more to do, Nibs?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93All right. Then we can lock up and go.\'94\
\
I had seen Lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon. Compared\
to John, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know. He was\
the opposite of his brother in almost every respect, being unusually\
shy and reserved. Yet he had a certain charm of manner, and I fancied\
that, if one really knew him well, one could have a deep affection for\
him. I had always fancied that his manner to Cynthia was rather\
constrained, and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him.\
But they were both gay enough this afternoon, and chatted together like\
a couple of children.\
\
As we drove through the village, I remembered that I wanted some\
stamps, so accordingly we pulled up at the post office.\
\
As I came out again, I cannoned into a little man who was just\
entering. I drew aside and apologised, when suddenly, with a loud\
exclamation, he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly.\
\
\'93_Mon ami_ Hastings!\'94 he cried. \'93It is indeed _mon ami_ Hastings!\'94\
\
\'93Poirot!\'94 I exclaimed.\
\
I turned to the pony-trap.\
\
\'93This is a very pleasant meeting for me, Miss Cynthia. This is my old\
friend, Monsieur Poirot, whom I have not seen for years.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, we know Monsieur Poirot,\'94 said Cynthia gaily. \'93But I had no idea\
he was a friend of yours.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, indeed,\'94 said Poirot seriously. \'93I know Mademoiselle Cynthia. It\
is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here.\'94 Then,\
as I looked at him inquiringly: \'93Yes, my friend, she had kindly\
extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are\
refugees from their native land. We Belgians will always remember her\
with gratitude.\'94\
\
Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than\
five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His\
head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little\
on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military. The neatness of\
his attire was almost incredible. I believe a speck of dust would have\
caused him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified\
little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, had been in his\
time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police. As a\
detective, his _flair_ had been extraordinary, and he had achieved\
triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day.\
\
He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow\
Belgians, and I promised to go and see him at an early date. Then he\
raised his hat with a flourish to Cynthia, and we drove away.\
\
\'93He\'92s a dear little man,\'94 said Cynthia. \'93I\'92d no idea you knew him.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares,\'94 I replied.\
\
And, for the rest of the way home, I recited to them the various\
exploits and triumphs of Hercule Poirot.\
\
We arrived back in a very cheerful mood. As we entered the hall, Mrs.\
Inglethorp came out of her boudoir. She looked flushed and upset.\
\
\'93Oh, it\'92s you,\'94 she said.\
\
\'93Is there anything the matter, Aunt Emily?\'94 asked Cynthia.\
\
\'93Certainly not,\'94 said Mrs. Inglethorp sharply. \'93What should there be?\'94\
Then catching sight of Dorcas, the parlourmaid, going into the\
dining-room, she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir.\
\
\'93Yes, m\'92m.\'94 The old servant hesitated, then added diffidently: \'93Don\'92t\
you think, m\'92m, you\'92d better get to bed? You\'92re looking very tired.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps you\'92re right, Dorcas\'97yes\'97no\'97not now. I\'92ve some letters I must\
finish by post-time. Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told\
you?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, m\'92m.\'94\
\
\'93Then I\'92ll go to bed directly after supper.\'94\
\
She went into the boudoir again, and Cynthia stared after her.\
\
\'93Goodness gracious! I wonder what\'92s up?\'94 she said to Lawrence.\
\
He did not seem to have heard her, for without a word he turned on his\
heel and went out of the house.\
\
I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and, Cynthia agreeing,\
I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet.\
\
Mrs. Cavendish was coming down the stairs. It may have been my fancy,\
but she, too, was looking odd and disturbed.\
\
\'93Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein?\'94 I asked, trying to appear as\
indifferent as I could.\
\
\'93I didn\'92t go,\'94 she replied abruptly. \'93Where is Mrs. Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93In the boudoir.\'94\
\
Her hand clenched itself on the banisters, then she seemed to nerve\
herself for some encounter, and went rapidly past me down the stairs\
across the hall to the boudoir, the door of which she shut behind her.\
\
As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later, I had to pass the\
open boudoir window, and was unable to help overhearing the following\
scrap of dialogue. Mary Cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman\
desperately controlling herself:\
\
\'93Then you won\'92t show it to me?\'94\
\
To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied:\
\
\'93My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter.\'94\
\
\'93Then show it to me.\'94\
\
\'93I tell you it is not what you imagine. It does not concern you in the\
least.\'94\
\
To which Mary Cavendish replied, with a rising bitterness:\
\
\'93Of course, I might have known you would shield him.\'94\
\
Cynthia was waiting for me, and greeted me eagerly with:\
\
\'93I say! There\'92s been the most awful row! I\'92ve got it all out of\
Dorcas.\'94\
\
\'93What kind of a row?\'94\
\
\'93Between Aunt Emily and _him_. I do hope she\'92s found him out at last!\'94\
\
\'93Was Dorcas there, then?\'94\
\
\'93Of course not. She \'91happened to be near the door\'92. It was a real old\
bust-up. I do wish I knew what it was all about.\'94\
\
I thought of Mrs. Raikes\'92s gipsy face, and Evelyn Howard\'92s warnings,\
but wisely decided to hold my peace, whilst Cynthia exhausted every\
possible hypothesis, and cheerfully hoped, \'93Aunt Emily will send him\
away, and will never speak to him again.\'94\
\
I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.\
Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon. I tried\
to forget the few words I had overheard; but, do what I would, I could\
not dismiss them altogether from my mind. What was Mary Cavendish\'92s\
concern in the matter?\
\
Mr. Inglethorp was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper. His\
face was impassive as ever, and the strange unreality of the man struck\
me afresh.\
\
Mrs. Inglethorp came down last. She still looked agitated, and during\
the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence. Inglethorp was\
unusually quiet. As a rule, he surrounded his wife with little\
attentions, placing a cushion at her back, and altogether playing the\
part of the devoted husband. Immediately after supper, Mrs. Inglethorp\
retired to her boudoir again.\
\
\'93Send my coffee in here, Mary,\'94 she called. \'93I\'92ve just five minutes to\
catch the post.\'94\
\
Cynthia and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room. Mary\
Cavendish brought our coffee to us. She seemed excited.\
\
\'93Do you young people want lights, or do you enjoy the twilight?\'94 she\
asked. \'93Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee, Cynthia? I will pour\
it out.\'94\
\
\'93Do not trouble, Mary,\'94 said Inglethorp. \'93I will take it to Emily.\'94 He\
poured it out, and went out of the room carrying it carefully.\
\
Lawrence followed him, and Mrs. Cavendish sat down by us.\
\
We three sat for some time in silence. It was a glorious night, hot and\
still. Mrs. Cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf.\
\
\'93It\'92s almost too hot,\'94 she murmured. \'93We shall have a thunderstorm.\'94\
\
Alas, that these harmonious moments can never endure! My paradise was\
rudely shattered by the sound of a well known, and heartily disliked,\
voice in the hall.\
\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein!\'94 exclaimed Cynthia. \'93What a funny time to come.\'94\
\
I glanced jealously at Mary Cavendish, but she seemed quite\
undisturbed, the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary.\
\
In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the\
latter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a\
drawing-room. In truth, he presented a sorry spectacle, being literally\
plastered with mud.\
\
\'93What have you been doing, doctor?\'94 cried Mrs. Cavendish.\
\
\'93I must make my apologies,\'94 said the doctor. \'93I did not really mean to\
come in, but Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\'94\
\
\'93Well, Bauerstein, you are in a plight,\'94 said John, strolling in from\
the hall. \'93Have some coffee, and tell us what you have been up to.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, I will.\'94 He laughed rather ruefully, as he described how he\
had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place,\
and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing, and slipped\
ignominiously into a neighbouring pond.\
\
\'93The sun soon dried me off,\'94 he added, \'93but I\'92m afraid my appearance is\
very disreputable.\'94\
\
At this juncture, Mrs. Inglethorp called to Cynthia from the hall, and\
the girl ran out.\
\
\'93Just carry up my despatch-case, will you, dear? I\'92m going to bed.\'94\
\
The door into the hall was a wide one. I had risen when Cynthia did,\
John was close by me. There were therefore three witnesses who could\
swear that Mrs. Inglethorp was carrying her coffee, as yet untasted, in\
her hand.\
\
My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of Dr.\
Bauerstein. It seemed to me the man would never go. He rose at last,\
however, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\
\
\'93I\'92ll walk down to the village with you,\'94 said Mr. Inglethorp. \'93I must\
see our agent over those estate accounts.\'94 He turned to John. \'93No one\
need sit up. I will take the latch-key.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III. THE NIGHT OF THE TRAGEDY\
\
To make this part of my story clear, I append the following plan of the\
first floor of Styles. The servants\'92 rooms are reached through the door\
B. They have no communication with the right wing, where the\
Inglethorps\'92 rooms were situated.\
\
\
\
\
       01\
\
\
\
It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence\
Cavendish. He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face\
told me at once that something was seriously wrong.\
\
\'93What\'92s the matter?\'94 I asked, sitting up in bed, and trying to collect\
my scattered thoughts.\
\
\'93We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind\
of fit. Unfortunately she has locked herself in.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ll come at once.\'94\
\
I sprang out of bed; and, pulling on a dressing-gown, followed Lawrence\
along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house.\
\
John Cavendish joined us, and one or two of the servants were standing\
round in a state of awe-stricken excitement. Lawrence turned to his\
brother.\
\
\'93What do you think we had better do?\'94\
\
Never, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.\
\
John rattled the handle of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s door violently, but with\
no effect. It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside. The whole\
household was aroused by now. The most alarming sounds were audible\
from the interior of the room. Clearly something must be done.\
\
\'93Try going through Mr. Inglethorp\'92s room, sir,\'94 cried Dorcas. \'93Oh, the\
poor mistress!\'94\
\
Suddenly I realized that Alfred Inglethorp was not with us\'97that he\
alone had given no sign of his presence. John opened the door of his\
room. It was pitch dark, but Lawrence was following with the candle,\
and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in, and\
that there was no sign of the room having been occupied.\
\
We went straight to the connecting door. That, too, was locked or\
bolted on the inside. What was to be done?\
\
\'93Oh, dear, sir,\'94 cried Dorcas, wringing her hands, \'93what ever shall we\
do?\'94\
\
\'93We must try and break the door in, I suppose. It\'92ll be a tough job,\
though. Here, let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him\
to go for Dr. Wilkins at once. Now then, we\'92ll have a try at the door.\
Half a moment, though, isn\'92t there a door into Miss Cynthia\'92s rooms?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, but that\'92s always bolted. It\'92s never been undone.\'94\
\
\'93Well, we might just see.\'94\
\
He ran rapidly down the corridor to Cynthia\'92s room. Mary Cavendish was\
there, shaking the girl\'97who must have been an unusually sound\
sleeper\'97and trying to wake her.\
\
In a moment or two he was back.\
\
\'93No good. That\'92s bolted too. We must break in the door. I think this\
one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage.\'94\
\
We strained and heaved together. The framework of the door was solid,\
and for a long time it resisted our efforts, but at last we felt it\
give beneath our weight, and finally, with a resounding crash, it was\
burst open.\
\
We stumbled in together, Lawrence still holding his candle. Mrs.\
Inglethorp was lying on the bed, her whole form agitated by violent\
convulsions, in one of which she must have overturned the table beside\
her. As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon\
the pillows.\
\
John strode across the room, and lit the gas. Turning to Annie, one of\
the housemaids, he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy.\
Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave\
on the corridor.\
\
I turned to Lawrence, to suggest that I had better leave them now that\
there was no further need of my services, but the words were frozen on\
my lips. Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man\'92s face. He\
was white as chalk, the candle he held in his shaking hand was\
sputtering onto the carpet, and his eyes, petrified with terror, or\
some such kindred emotion, stared fixedly over my head at a point on\
the further wall. It was as though he had seen something that turned\
him to stone. I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes, but I\
could see nothing unusual. The still feebly flickering ashes in the\
grate, and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece, were surely\
harmless enough.\
\
The violence of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s attack seemed to be passing. She was\
able to speak in short gasps.\
\
\'93Better now\'97very sudden\'97stupid of me\'97to lock myself in.\'94\
\
A shadow fell on the bed and, looking up, I saw Mary Cavendish standing\
near the door with her arm around Cynthia. She seemed to be supporting\
the girl, who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself. Her face was\
heavily flushed, and she yawned repeatedly.\
\
\'93Poor Cynthia is quite frightened,\'94 said Mrs. Cavendish in a low clear\
voice. She herself, I noticed, was dressed in her white land smock.\
Then it must be later than I thought. I saw that a faint streak of\
daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows, and that the\
clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o\'92clock.\
\
A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized\
the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible\
to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged round her, powerless\
to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until\
she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels, with her body arched\
in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer\
more brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in that\
peculiar fashion.\
\
At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the\
room. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure on the\
bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled\
voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\
\
\'93Alfred\'97Alfred\'97\'97\'94 Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\
\
With a stride, the doctor reached the bed, and seizing her arms worked\
them energetically, applying what I knew to be artificial respiration.\
He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants. An imperious wave\
of his hand drove us all to the door. We watched him, fascinated,\
though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late, and that\
nothing could be done now. I could see by the expression on his face\
that he himself had little hope.\
\
Finally he abandoned his task, shaking his head gravely. At that\
moment, we heard footsteps outside, and Dr. Wilkins, Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
own doctor, a portly, fussy little man, came bustling in.\
\
In a few words Dr. Bauerstein explained how he had happened to be\
passing the lodge gates as the car came out, and had run up to the\
house as fast as he could, whilst the car went on to fetch Dr. Wilkins.\
With a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.\
\
\'93Ve\'97ry sad. Ve\'97ry sad,\'94 murmured Dr. Wilkins. \'93Poor dear lady. Always\
did far too much\'97far too much\'97against my advice. I warned her. Her\
heart was far from strong. \'91Take it easy,\'92 I said to her,\
\'91Take\'97it\'97easy\'92. But no\'97her zeal for good works was too great. Nature\
rebelled. Na\'97ture\'97re\'97belled.\'94\
\
Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly. He\
still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke.\
\
\'93The convulsions were of a peculiar violence, Dr. Wilkins. I am sorry\
you were not here in time to witness them. They were quite\'97tetanic in\
character.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 said Dr. Wilkins wisely.\
\
\'93I should like to speak to you in private,\'94 said Dr. Bauerstein. He\
turned to John. \'93You do not object?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly not.\'94\
\
We all trooped out into the corridor, leaving the two doctors alone,\
and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us.\
\
We went slowly down the stairs. I was violently excited. I have a\
certain talent for deduction, and Dr. Bauerstein\'92s manner had started a\
flock of wild surmises in my mind. Mary Cavendish laid her hand upon my\
arm.\
\
\'93What is it? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so\'97peculiar?\'94\
\
I looked at her.\
\
\'93Do you know what I think?\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93Listen!\'94 I looked round, the others were out of earshot. I lowered my\
voice to a whisper. \'93I believe she has been poisoned! I\'92m certain Dr.\
Bauerstein suspects it.\'94\
\
\'93_What?_\'94 She shrank against the wall, the pupils of her eyes dilating\
wildly. Then, with a sudden cry that startled me, she cried out: \'93No,\
no\'97not that\'97not that!\'94 And breaking from me, fled up the stairs. I\
followed her, afraid that she was going to faint. I found her leaning\
against the bannisters, deadly pale. She waved me away impatiently.\
\
\'93No, no\'97leave me. I\'92d rather be alone. Let me just be quiet for a\
minute or two. Go down to the others.\'94\
\
I obeyed her reluctantly. John and Lawrence were in the dining-room. I\
joined them. We were all silent, but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of\
us all when I at last broke it by saying:\
\
\'93Where is Mr. Inglethorp?\'94\
\
John shook his head.\
\
\'93He\'92s not in the house.\'94\
\
Our eyes met. Where _was_ Alfred Inglethorp? His absence was strange\
and inexplicable. I remembered Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s dying words. What lay\
beneath them? What more could she have told us, if she had had time?\
\
At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs. Dr. Wilkins was\
looking important and excited, and trying to conceal an inward\
exultation under a manner of decorous calm. Dr. Bauerstein remained in\
the background, his grave bearded face unchanged. Dr. Wilkins was the\
spokesman for the two. He addressed himself to John:\
\
\'93Mr. Cavendish, I should like your consent to a post-mortem.\'94\
\
\'93Is that necessary?\'94 asked John gravely. A spasm of pain crossed his\
face.\
\
\'93Absolutely,\'94 said Dr. Bauerstein.\
\
\'93You mean by that\'97\'97?\'94\
\
\'93That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate\
under the circumstances.\'94\
\
John bent his head.\
\
\'93In that case, I have no alternative but to agree.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you,\'94 said Dr. Wilkins briskly. \'93We propose that it should take\
place to-morrow night\'97or rather to-night.\'94 And he glanced at the\
daylight. \'93Under the circumstances, I am afraid an inquest can hardly\
be avoided\'97these formalities are necessary, but I beg that you won\'92t\
distress yourselves.\'94\
\
There was a pause, and then Dr. Bauerstein drew two keys from his\
pocket, and handed them to John.\
\
\'93These are the keys of the two rooms. I have locked them and, in my\
opinion, they would be better kept locked for the present.\'94\
\
The doctors then departed.\
\
I had been turning over an idea in my head, and I felt that the moment\
had now come to broach it. Yet I was a little chary of doing so. John,\
I knew, had a horror of any kind of publicity, and was an easygoing\
optimist, who preferred never to meet trouble half-way. It might be\
difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan. Lawrence, on the\
other hand, being less conventional, and having more imagination, I\
felt I might count upon as an ally. There was no doubt that the moment\
had come for me to take the lead.\
\
\'93John,\'94 I said, \'93I am going to ask you something.\'94\
\
\'93Well?\'94\
\
\'93You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot? The Belgian who is here?\
He has been a most famous detective.\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I want you to let me call him in\'97to investigate this matter.\'94\
\
\'93What\'97now? Before the post-mortem?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, time is an advantage if\'97if\'97there has been foul play.\'94\
\
\'93Rubbish!\'94 cried Lawrence angrily. \'93In my opinion the whole thing is a\
mare\'92s nest of Bauerstein\'92s! Wilkins hadn\'92t an idea of such a thing,\
until Bauerstein put it into his head. But, like all specialists,\
Bauerstein\'92s got a bee in his bonnet. Poisons are his hobby, so of\
course he sees them everywhere.\'94\
\
I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence\'92s attitude. He was so seldom\
vehement about anything.\
\
John hesitated.\
\
\'93I can\'92t feel as you do, Lawrence,\'94 he said at last. \'93I\'92m inclined to\
give Hastings a free hand, though I should prefer to wait a bit. We\
don\'92t want any unnecessary scandal.\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94 I cried eagerly, \'93you need have no fear of that. Poirot is\
discretion itself.\'94\
\
\'93Very well, then, have it your own way. I leave it in your hands.\
Though, if it is as we suspect, it seems a clear enough case. God\
forgive me if I am wronging him!\'94\
\
I looked at my watch. It was six o\'92clock. I determined to lose no time.\
\
Five minutes\'92 delay, however, I allowed myself. I spent it in\
ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a\
description of strychnine poisoning.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV. POIROT INVESTIGATES\
\
The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to\
the park gates. One could save time by taking a narrow path through the\
long grass, which cut off the detours of the winding drive. So I,\
accordingly, went that way. I had nearly reached the lodge, when my\
attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me.\
It was Mr. Inglethorp. Where had he been? How did he intend to explain\
his absence?\
\
He accosted me eagerly.\
\
\'93My God! This is terrible! My poor wife! I have only just heard.\'94\
\
\'93Where have you been?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Denby kept me late last night. It was one o\'92clock before we\'92d\
finished. Then I found that I\'92d forgotten the latch-key after all. I\
didn\'92t want to arouse the household, so Denby gave me a bed.\'94\
\
\'93How did you hear the news?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him. My poor Emily! She was so\
self-sacrificing\'97such a noble character. She over-taxed her strength.\'94\
\
A wave of revulsion swept over me. What a consummate hypocrite the man\
was!\
\
\'93I must hurry on,\'94 I said, thankful that he did not ask me whither I\
was bound.\
\
In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage.\
\
Getting no answer, I repeated my summons impatiently. A window above me\
was cautiously opened, and Poirot himself looked out.\
\
He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me. In a few brief words,\
I explained the tragedy that had occurred, and that I wanted his help.\
\
\'93Wait, my friend, I will let you in, and you shall recount to me the\
affair whilst I dress.\'94\
\
In a few moments he had unbarred the door, and I followed him up to his\
room. There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story,\
keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however\
insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.\
\
I told him of my awakening, of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s dying words, of her\
husband\'92s absence, of the quarrel the day before, of the scrap of\
conversation between Mary and her mother-in-law that I had overheard,\
of the former quarrel between Mrs. Inglethorp and Evelyn Howard, and of\
the latter\'92s innuendoes.\
\
I was hardly as clear as I could wish. I repeated myself several times,\
and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten.\
Poirot smiled kindly on me.\
\
\'93The mind is confused? Is it not so? Take time, _mon ami_. You are\
agitated; you are excited\'97it is but natural. Presently, when we are\
calmer, we will arrange the facts, neatly, each in his proper place. We\
will examine\'97and reject. Those of importance we will put on one side;\
those of no importance, pouf!\'94\'97he screwed up his cherub-like face, and\
puffed comically enough\'97\'93blow them away!\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s all very well,\'94 I objected, \'93but how are you going to decide\
what is important, and what isn\'92t? That always seems the difficulty to\
me.\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head energetically. He was now arranging his moustache\
with exquisite care.\
\
\'93Not so. _Voyons!_ One fact leads to another\'97so we continue. Does the\
next fit in with that? _A merveille!_ Good! We can proceed. This next\
little fact\'97no! Ah, that is curious! There is something missing\'97a link\
in the chain that is not there. We examine. We search. And that little\
curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally,\
we put it here!\'94 He made an extravagant gesture with his hand. \'93It is\
significant! It is tremendous!\'94\
\
\'93Y\'97es\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 Poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed\
before it. \'93Beware! Peril to the detective who says: \'91It is so small\'97it\
does not matter. It will not agree. I will forget it.\'92 That way lies\
confusion! Everything matters.\'94\
\
\'93I know. You always told me that. That\'92s why I have gone into all the\
details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not.\'94\
\
\'93And I am pleased with you. You have a good memory, and you have given\
me the facts faithfully. Of the order in which you present them, I say\
nothing\'97truly, it is deplorable! But I make allowances\'97you are upset.\
To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of\
paramount importance.\'94\
\
\'93What is that?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night.\'94\
\
I stared at him. Surely the war had affected the little man\'92s brain. He\
was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and\
seemed wholly engrossed in the task.\
\
\'93I don\'92t remember,\'94 I said. \'93And, anyway, I don\'92t see\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93You do not see? But it is of the first importance.\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t see why,\'94 I said, rather nettled. \'93As far as I can remember,\
she didn\'92t eat much. She was obviously upset, and it had taken her\
appetite away. That was only natural.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Poirot thoughtfully, \'93it was only natural.\'94\
\
He opened a drawer, and took out a small despatch-case, then turned to\
me.\
\
\'93Now I am ready. We will proceed to the ch\'e2teau, and study matters on\
the spot. Excuse me, _mon ami_, you dressed in haste, and your tie is\
on one side. Permit me.\'94 With a deft gesture, he rearranged it.\
\
\'93_\'c7a y est!_ Now, shall we start?\'94\
\
We hurried up the village, and turned in at the lodge gates. Poirot\
stopped for a moment, and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse\
of park, still glittering with morning dew.\
\
\'93So beautiful, so beautiful, and yet, the poor family, plunged in\
sorrow, prostrated with grief.\'94\
\
He looked at me keenly as he spoke, and I was aware that I reddened\
under his prolonged gaze.\
\
Was the family prostrated by grief? Was the sorrow at Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
death so great? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the\
atmosphere. The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love. Her\
death was a shock and a distress, but she would not be passionately\
regretted.\
\
Poirot seemed to follow my thoughts. He nodded his head gravely.\
\
\'93No, you are right,\'94 he said, \'93it is not as though there was a blood\
tie. She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes, but she was\
not their own mother. Blood tells\'97always remember that\'97blood tells.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I said, \'93I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if\
Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night? I have been turning it over in my\
mind, but I can\'92t see how it has anything to do with the matter?\'94\
\
He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along, but finally he\
said:\
\
\'93I do not mind telling you\'97though, as you know, it is not my habit to\
explain until the end is reached. The present contention is that Mrs.\
Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning, presumably administered in her\
coffee.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93Well, what time was the coffee served?\'94\
\
\'93About eight o\'92clock.\'94\
\
\'93Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight\'97certainly not\
much later. Well, strychnine is a fairly rapid poison. Its effects\
would be felt very soon, probably in about an hour. Yet, in Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s case, the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five\
o\'92clock the next morning: nine hours! But a heavy meal, taken at about\
the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to\
that extent. Still, it is a possibility to be taken into account. But,\
according to you, she ate very little for supper, and yet the symptoms\
do not develop until early the next morning! Now that is a curious\
circumstance, my friend. Something may arise at the autopsy to explain\
it. In the meantime, remember it.\'94\
\
As we neared the house, John came out and met us. His face looked weary\
and haggard.\
\
\'93This is a very dreadful business, Monsieur Poirot,\'94 he said. \'93Hastings\
has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity?\'94\
\
\'93I comprehend perfectly.\'94\
\
\'93You see, it is only suspicion so far. We have nothing to go upon.\'94\
\
\'93Precisely. It is a matter of precaution only.\'94\
\
John turned to me, taking out his cigarette-case, and lighting a\
cigarette as he did so.\
\
\'93You know that fellow Inglethorp is back?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. I met him.\'94\
\
John flung the match into an adjacent flower bed, a proceeding which\
was too much for Poirot\'92s feelings. He retrieved it, and buried it\
neatly.\
\
\'93It\'92s jolly difficult to know how to treat him.\'94\
\
\'93That difficulty will not exist long,\'94 pronounced Poirot quietly.\
\
John looked puzzled, not quite understanding the portent of this\
cryptic saying. He handed the two keys which Dr. Bauerstein had given\
him to me.\
\
\'93Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see.\'94\
\
\'93The rooms are locked?\'94 asked Poirot.\
\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded thoughtfully.\
\
\'93Then he is very sure. Well, that simplifies matters for us.\'94\
\
We went up together to the room of the tragedy. For convenience I\
append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in\
it.\
\
\
\
\
       02\
\
\
\
Poirot locked the door on the inside, and proceeded to a minute\
inspection of the room. He darted from one object to the other with the\
agility of a grasshopper. I remained by the door, fearing to obliterate\
any clues. Poirot, however, did not seem grateful to me for my\
forbearance.\
\
\'93What have you, my friend,\'94 he cried, \'93that you remain there like\'97how\
do you say it?\'97ah, yes, the stuck pig?\'94\
\
I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks.\
\
\'93Foot-marks? But what an idea! There has already been practically an\
army in the room! What foot-marks are we likely to find? No, come here\
and aid me in my search. I will put down my little case until I need\
it.\'94\
\
He did so, on the round table by the window, but it was an ill-advised\
proceeding; for, the top of it being loose, it tilted up, and\
precipitated the despatch-case on the floor.\
\
\'93_Eh voil\'e0 une table!_\'94 cried Poirot. \'93Ah, my friend, one may live in a\
big house and yet have no comfort.\'94\
\
After which piece of moralizing, he resumed his search.\
\
A small purple despatch-case, with a key in the lock, on the\
writing-table, engaged his attention for some time. He took out the key\
from the lock, and passed it to me to inspect. I saw nothing peculiar,\
however. It was an ordinary key of the Yale type, with a bit of twisted\
wire through the handle.\
\
Next, he examined the framework of the door we had broken in, assuring\
himself that the bolt had really been shot. Then he went to the door\
opposite leading into Cynthia\'92s room. That door was also bolted, as I\
had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening\
and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution\
against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed\
to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly\
whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case, he drew out some\
minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.\
\
On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small\
saucepan on it. A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the\
saucepan, and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood\
near it.\
\
I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this.\
Here was a clue worth having. Poirot delicately dipped his finger into\
liquid, and tasted it gingerly. He made a grimace.\
\
\'93Cocoa\'97with\'97I think\'97rum in it.\'94\
\
He passed on to the debris on the floor, where the table by the bed had\
been overturned. A reading-lamp, some books, matches, a bunch of keys,\
and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about.\
\
\'93Ah, this is curious,\'94 said Poirot.\
\
\'93I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it.\'94\
\
\'93You do not? Observe the lamp\'97the chimney is broken in two places; they\
lie there as they fell. But see, the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed\
to powder.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I said wearily, \'93I suppose someone must have stepped on it.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Poirot, in an odd voice. \'93Someone stepped on it.\'94\
\
He rose from his knees, and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece,\
where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments, and straightening\
them\'97a trick of his when he was agitated.\
\
\'93_Mon ami_,\'94 he said, turning to me, \'93somebody stepped on that cup,\
grinding it to powder, and the reason they did so was either because it\
contained strychnine or\'97which is far more serious\'97because it did not\
contain strychnine!\'94\
\
I made no reply. I was bewildered, but I knew that it was no good\
asking him to explain. In a moment or two he roused himself, and went\
on with his investigations. He picked up the bunch of keys from the\
floor, and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one,\
very bright and shining, which he tried in the lock of the purple\
despatch-case. It fitted, and he opened the box, but after a moment\'92s\
hesitation, closed and relocked it, and slipped the bunch of keys, as\
well as the key that had originally stood in the lock, into his own\
pocket.\
\
\'93I have no authority to go through these papers. But it should be\
done\'97at once!\'94\
\
He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the\
wash-stand. Crossing the room to the left-hand window, a round stain,\
hardly visible on the dark brown carpet, seemed to interest him\
particularly. He went down on his knees, examining it minutely\'97even\
going so far as to smell it.\
\
Finally, he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube, sealing\
it up carefully. His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook.\
\
\'93We have found in this room,\'94 he said, writing busily, \'93six points of\
interest. Shall I enumerate them, or will you?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, you,\'94 I replied hastily.\
\
\'93Very well, then. One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder;\
two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the\
floor.\'94\
\
\'93That may have been done some time ago,\'94 I interrupted.\
\
\'93No, for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee. Four, a\
fragment of some dark green fabric\'97only a thread or two, but\
recognizable.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 I cried. \'93That was what you sealed up in the envelope.\'94\
\
\'93Yes. It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s own\
dresses, and quite unimportant. We shall see. Five, _this_!\'94 With a\
dramatic gesture, he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the\
floor by the writing-table. \'93It must have been done since yesterday,\
otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with\
blotting-paper and a hot iron. One of my best hats once\'97but that is not\
to the point.\'94\
\
\'93It was very likely done last night. We were very agitated. Or perhaps\
Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle.\'94\
\
\'93You brought only one candle into the room?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it. But he was very upset. He\
seemed to see something over here\'94\'97I indicated the mantelpiece\'97\'93that\
absolutely paralysed him.\'94\
\
\'93That is interesting,\'94 said Poirot quickly. \'93Yes, it is suggestive\'94\'97his\
eye sweeping the whole length of the wall\'97\'93but it was not his candle\
that made this great patch, for you perceive that this is white grease;\
whereas Monsieur Lawrence\'92s candle, which is still on the\
dressing-table, is pink. On the other hand, Mrs. Inglethorp had no\
candlestick in the room, only a reading-lamp.\'94\
\
\'93Then,\'94 I said, \'93what do you deduce?\'94\
\
To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply, urging me to\
use my own natural faculties.\
\
\'93And the sixth point?\'94 I asked. \'93I suppose it is the sample of cocoa.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Poirot thoughtfully. \'93I might have included that in the six,\
but I did not. No, the sixth point I will keep to myself for the\
present.\'94\
\
He looked quickly round the room. \'93There is nothing more to be done\
here, I think, unless\'94\'97he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes\
in the grate. \'93The fire burns\'97and it destroys. But by chance\'97there\
might be\'97let us see!\'94\
\
Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate\
into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution. Suddenly, he\
gave a faint exclamation.\
\
\'93The forceps, Hastings!\'94\
\
I quickly handed them to him, and with skill he extracted a small piece\
of half charred paper.\
\
\'93There, _mon ami!_\'94 he cried. \'93What do you think of that?\'94\
\
I scrutinized the fragment. This is an exact reproduction of it:\'97\
\
\
\
\
       03\
\
\
I was puzzled. It was unusually thick, quite unlike ordinary notepaper.\
Suddenly an idea struck me.\
\
\'93Poirot!\'94 I cried. \'93This is a fragment of a will!\'94\
\
\'93Exactly.\'94\
\
I looked up at him sharply.\
\
\'93You are not surprised?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said gravely, \'93I expected it.\'94\
\
I relinquished the piece of paper, and watched him put it away in his\
case, with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything. My\
brain was in a whirl. What was this complication of a will? Who had\
destroyed it? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor?\
Obviously. But how had anyone gained admission? All the doors had been\
bolted on the inside.\
\
\'93Now, my friend,\'94 said Poirot briskly, \'93we will go. I should like to\
ask a few questions of the parlourmaid\'97Dorcas, her name is, is it not?\'94\
\
We passed through Alfred Inglethorp\'92s room, and Poirot delayed long\
enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it. We\
went out through that door, locking both it and that of Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s room as before.\
\
I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see,\
and went myself in search of Dorcas.\
\
When I returned with her, however, the boudoir was empty.\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I cried, \'93where are you?\'94\
\
\'93I am here, my friend.\'94\
\
He had stepped outside the French window, and was standing, apparently\
lost in admiration, before the various shaped flower beds.\
\
\'93Admirable!\'94 he murmured. \'93Admirable! What symmetry! Observe that\
crescent; and those diamonds\'97their neatness rejoices the eye. The\
spacing of the plants, also, is perfect. It has been recently done; is\
it not so?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon. But come in\'97Dorcas\
is here.\'94\
\
\'93_Eh bien, eh bien!_ Do not grudge me a moment\'92s satisfaction of the\
eye.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but this affair is more important.\'94\
\
\'93And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal\
importance?\'94\
\
I shrugged my shoulders. There was really no arguing with him if he\
chose to take that line.\
\
\'93You do not agree? But such things have been. Well, we will come in and\
interview the brave Dorcas.\'94\
\
Dorcas was standing in the boudoir, her hands folded in front of her,\
and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap. She was the\
very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant.\
\
In her attitude towards Poirot, she was inclined to be suspicious, but\
he soon broke down her defences. He drew forward a chair.\
\
\'93Pray be seated, mademoiselle.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, sir.\'94\
\
\'93You have been with your mistress many years, is it not so?\'94\
\
\'93Ten years, sir.\'94\
\
\'93That is a long time, and very faithful service. You were much attached\
to her, were you not?\'94\
\
\'93She was a very good mistress to me, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Then you will not object to answering a few questions. I put them to\
you with Mr. Cavendish\'92s full approval.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, certainly, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday\
afternoon. Your mistress had a quarrel?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir. But I don\'92t know that I ought\'97\'97\'94 Dorcas hesitated.\
\
Poirot looked at her keenly.\
\
\'93My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of\
that quarrel as fully as possible. Do not think that you are betraying\
your mistress\'92s secrets. Your mistress lies dead, and it is necessary\
that we should know all\'97if we are to avenge her. Nothing can bring her\
back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the\
murderer to justice.\'94\
\
\'93Amen to that,\'94 said Dorcas fiercely. \'93And, naming no names, there\'92s\
_one_ in this house that none of us could ever abide! And an ill day it\
was when first _he_ darkened the threshold.\'94\
\
Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his\
business-like tone, he asked:\
\
\'93Now, as to this quarrel? What is the first you heard of it?\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir, I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What time was that?\'94\
\
\'93I couldn\'92t say exactly, sir, but it wasn\'92t tea-time by a long way.\
Perhaps four o\'92clock\'97or it may have been a bit later. Well, sir, as I\
said, I happened to be passing along, when I heard voices very loud and\
angry in here. I didn\'92t exactly mean to listen, but\'97well, there it is.\
I stopped. The door was shut, but the mistress was speaking very sharp\
and clear, and I heard what she said quite plainly. \'91You have lied to\
me, and deceived me,\'92 she said. I didn\'92t hear what Mr. Inglethorp\
replied. He spoke a good bit lower than she did\'97but she answered: \'91How\
dare you? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you! You owe\
everything to me! And this is how you repay me! By bringing disgrace\
upon our name!\'92 Again I didn\'92t hear what he said, but she went on:\
\'91Nothing that you can say will make any difference. I see my duty\
clearly. My mind is made up. You need not think that any fear of\
publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\'92 Then I\
thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly.\'94\
\
\'93You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp\'92s voice you heard?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, sir, whose else\'92s could it be?\'94\
\
\'93Well, what happened next?\'94\
\
\'93Later, I came back to the hall; but it was all quiet. At five o\'92clock,\
Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of\
tea\'97nothing to eat\'97to the boudoir. She was looking dreadful\'97so white\
and upset. \'91Dorcas,\'92 she says, \'91I\'92ve had a great shock.\'92 \'91I\'92m sorry for\
that, m\'92m,\'92 I says. \'91You\'92ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea,\
m\'92m.\'92 She had something in her hand. I don\'92t know if it was a letter,\
or just a piece of paper, but it had writing on it, and she kept\
staring at it, almost as if she couldn\'92t believe what was written\
there. She whispered to herself, as though she had forgotten I was\
there: \'91These few words\'97and everything\'92s changed.\'92 And then she says to\
me: \'91Never trust a man, Dorcas, they\'92re not worth it!\'92 I hurried off,\
and got her a good strong cup of tea, and she thanked me, and said\
she\'92d feel better when she\'92d drunk it. \'91I don\'92t know what to do,\'92 she\
says. \'91Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.\
I\'92d rather hush it up if I could.\'92 Mrs. Cavendish came in just then, so\
she didn\'92t say any more.\'94\
\
\'93She still had the letter, or whatever it was, in her hand?\'94\
\
\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
\'93What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?\'94\
\
\'93Well, I don\'92t know, sir, I expect she would lock it up in that purple\
case of hers.\'94\
\
\'93Is that where she usually kept important papers?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir. She brought it down with her every morning, and took it up\
every night.\'94\
\
\'93When did she lose the key of it?\'94\
\
\'93She missed it yesterday at lunch-time, sir, and told me to look\
carefully for it. She was very much put out about it.\'94\
\
\'93But she had a duplicate key?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, sir.\'94\
\
Dorcas was looking very curiously at him and, to tell the truth, so was\
I. What was all this about a lost key? Poirot smiled.\
\
\'93Never mind, Dorcas, it is my business to know things. Is this the key\
that was lost?\'94 He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in\
the lock of the despatch-case upstairs.\
\
Dorcas\'92s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head.\
\
\'93That\'92s it, sir, right enough. But where did you find it? I looked\
everywhere for it.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was\
to-day. Now, to pass to another subject, had your mistress a dark green\
dress in her wardrobe?\'94\
\
Dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question.\
\
\'93No, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Are you quite sure?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Has anyone else in the house got a green dress?\'94\
\
Dorcas reflected.\
\
\'93Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress.\'94\
\
\'93Light or dark green?\'94\
\
\'93A light green, sir; a sort of chiffon, they call it.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, that is not what I want. And nobody else has anything green?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir\'97not that I know of.\'94\
\
Poirot\'92s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or\
otherwise. He merely remarked:\
\
\'93Good, we will leave that and pass on. Have you any reason to believe\
that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night?\'94\
\
\'93Not _last_ night, sir, I know she didn\'92t.\'94\
\
\'93Why do you know so positively?\'94\
\
\'93Because the box was empty. She took the last one two days ago, and she\
didn\'92t have any more made up.\'94\
\
\'93You are quite sure of that?\'94\
\
\'93Positive, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Then that is cleared up! By the way, your mistress didn\'92t ask you to\
sign any paper yesterday?\'94\
\
\'93To sign a paper? No, sir.\'94\
\
\'93When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening, they\
found your mistress busy writing letters. I suppose you can give me no\
idea to whom these letters were addressed?\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m afraid I couldn\'92t, sir. I was out in the evening. Perhaps Annie\
could tell you, though she\'92s a careless girl. Never cleared the\
coffee-cups away last night. That\'92s what happens when I\'92m not here to\
look after things.\'94\
\
Poirot lifted his hand.\
\
\'93Since they have been left, Dorcas, leave them a little longer, I pray\
you. I should like to examine them.\'94\
\
\'93Very well, sir.\'94\
\
\'93What time did you go out last evening?\'94\
\
\'93About six o\'92clock, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, Dorcas, that is all I have to ask you.\'94 He rose and\
strolled to the window. \'93I have been admiring these flower beds. How\
many gardeners are employed here, by the way?\'94\
\
\'93Only three now, sir. Five, we had, before the war, when it was kept as\
a gentleman\'92s place should be. I wish you could have seen it then, sir.\
A fair sight it was. But now there\'92s only old Manning, and young\
William, and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like.\
Ah, these are dreadful times!\'94\
\
\'93The good times will come again, Dorcas. At least, we hope so. Now,\
will you send Annie to me here?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.\'94\
\
\'93How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders?\'94 I asked,\
in lively curiosity, as Dorcas left the room. \'93And about the lost key\
and the duplicate?\'94\
\
\'93One thing at a time. As to the sleeping powders, I knew by this.\'94 He\
suddenly produced a small cardboard box, such as chemists use for\
powders.\
\
\'93Where did you find it?\'94\
\
\'93In the wash-stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s bedroom. It was Number\
Six of my catalogue.\'94\
\
\'93But I suppose, as the last powder was taken two days ago, it is not of\
much importance?\'94\
\
\'93Probably not, but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar\
about this box?\'94\
\
I examined it closely.\
\
\'93No, I can\'92t say that I do.\'94\
\
\'93Look at the label.\'94\
\
I read the label carefully: \'93\'91One powder to be taken at bedtime, if\
required. Mrs. Inglethorp.\'92 No, I see nothing unusual.\'94\
\
\'93Not the fact that there is no chemist\'92s name?\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 I exclaimed. \'93To be sure, that is odd!\'94\
\
\'93Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that, without his\
printed name?\'94\
\
\'93No, I can\'92t say that I have.\'94\
\
I was becoming quite excited, but Poirot damped my ardour by remarking:\
\
\'93Yet the explanation is quite simple. So do not intrigue yourself, my\
friend.\'94\
\
An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of Annie, so I had no time\
to reply.\
\
Annie was a fine, strapping girl, and was evidently labouring under\
intense excitement, mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the\
tragedy.\
\
Poirot came to the point at once, with a business-like briskness.\
\
\'93I sent for you, Annie, because I thought you might be able to tell me\
something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night. How many\
were there? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses?\'94\
\
Annie considered.\
\
\'93There were four letters, sir. One was to Miss Howard, and one was to\
Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don\'92t think I remember,\
sir\'97oh, yes, one was to Ross\'92s, the caterers in Tadminster. The other\
one, I don\'92t remember.\'94\
\
\'93Think,\'94 urged Poirot.\
\
Annie racked her brains in vain.\
\
\'93I\'92m sorry, sir, but it\'92s clean gone. I don\'92t think I can have noticed\
it.\'94\
\
\'93It does not matter,\'94 said Poirot, not betraying any sign of\
disappointment. \'93Now I want to ask you about something else. There is a\
saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room with some cocoa in it. Did she have\
that every night?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, it was put in her room every evening, and she warmed it up\
in the night\'97whenever she fancied it.\'94\
\
\'93What was it? Plain cocoa?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, made with milk, with a teaspoonful of sugar, and two\
teaspoonfuls of rum in it.\'94\
\
\'93Who took it to her room?\'94\
\
\'93I did, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Always?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
\'93At what time?\'94\
\
\'93When I went to draw the curtains, as a rule, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir, you see there\'92s not much room on the gas stove, so cook used\
to make it early, before putting the vegetables on for supper. Then I\
used to bring it up, and put it on the table by the swing door, and\
take it into her room later.\'94\
\
\'93The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
\'93And the table, is it on this side of the door, or on the\
farther\'97servants\'92 side?\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s this side, sir.\'94\
\
\'93What time did you bring it up last night?\'94\
\
\'93About quarter-past seven, I should say, sir.\'94\
\
\'93And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room?\'94\
\
\'93When I went to shut up, sir. About eight o\'92clock. Mrs. Inglethorp came\
up to bed before I\'92d finished.\'94\
\
\'93Then, between seven-fifteen and eight o\'92clock, the cocoa was standing\
on the table in the left wing?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94 Annie had been growing redder and redder in the face, and\
now she blurted out unexpectedly:\
\
\'93And if there _was_ salt in it, sir, it wasn\'92t me. I never took the\
salt near it.\'94\
\
\'93What makes you think there was salt in it?\'94 asked Poirot.\
\
\'93Seeing it on the tray, sir.\'94\
\
\'93You saw some salt on the tray?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Coarse kitchen salt, it looked. I never noticed it when I took\
the tray up, but when I came to take it into the mistress\'92s room I saw\
it at once, and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again, and\
asked cook to make some fresh. But I was in a hurry, because Dorcas was\
out, and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right, and the salt\
had only gone on the tray. So I dusted it off with my apron, and took\
it in.\'94\
\
I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement. Unknown to\
herself, Annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence. How\
she would have gaped if she had realized that her \'93coarse kitchen salt\'94\
was strychnine, one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind. I\
marvelled at Poirot\'92s calm. His self-control was astonishing. I awaited\
his next question with impatience, but it disappointed me.\
\
\'93When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room, was the door leading into\
Miss Cynthia\'92s room bolted?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! Yes, sir; it always was. It had never been opened.\'94\
\
\'93And the door into Mr. Inglethorp\'92s room? Did you notice if that was\
bolted too?\'94\
\
Annie hesitated.\
\
\'93I couldn\'92t rightly say, sir; it was shut but I couldn\'92t say whether it\
was bolted or not.\'94\
\
\'93When you finally left the room, did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door\
after you?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir, not then, but I expect she did later. She usually did lock it\
at night. The door into the passage, that is.\'94\
\
\'93Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room\
yesterday?\'94\
\
\'93Candle grease? Oh, no, sir. Mrs. Inglethorp didn\'92t have a candle, only\
a reading-lamp.\'94\
\
\'93Then, if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor,\
you think you would have been sure to have seen it?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper\
and a hot iron.\'94\
\
Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas:\
\
\'93Did your mistress ever have a green dress?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Nor a mantle, nor a cape, nor a\'97how do you call it?\'97a sports coat?\'94\
\
\'93Not green, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Nor anyone else in the house?\'94\
\
Annie reflected.\
\
\'93No, sir.\'94\
\
\'93You are sure of that?\'94\
\
\'93Quite sure.\'94\
\
\'93_Bien!_ That is all I want to know. Thank you very much.\'94\
\
With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.\
My pent-up excitement burst forth.\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I cried, \'93I congratulate you! This is a great discovery.\'94\
\
\'93What is a great discovery?\'94\
\
\'93Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned. That\
explains everything! Of course it did not take effect until the early\
morning, since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night.\'94\
\
\'93So you think that the cocoa\'97mark well what I say, Hastings, the\
_cocoa_\'97contained strychnine?\'94\
\
\'93Of course! That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?\'94\
\
\'93It might have been salt,\'94 replied Poirot placidly.\
\
I shrugged my shoulders. If he was going to take the matter that way,\
it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the\
first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought\
it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive\
type of mind.\
\
Poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes.\
\
\'93You are not pleased with me, _mon ami?_\'94\
\
\'93My dear Poirot,\'94 I said coldly, \'93it is not for me to dictate to you.\
You have a right to your own opinion, just as I have to mine.\'94\
\
\'93A most admirable sentiment,\'94 remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his\
feet. \'93Now I have finished with this room. By the way, whose is the\
smaller desk in the corner?\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Inglethorp\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 He tried the roll top tentatively. \'93Locked. But perhaps one of\
Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s keys would open it.\'94 He tried several, twisting and\
turning them with a practiced hand, and finally uttering an ejaculation\
of satisfaction. \'93_Voil\'e0!_ It is not the key, but it will open it at a\
pinch.\'94 He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly\
filed papers. To my surprise, he did not examine them, merely remarking\
approvingly as he relocked the desk: \'93Decidedly, he is a man of method,\
this Mr. Inglethorp!\'94\
\
A \'93man of method\'94 was, in Poirot\'92s estimation, the highest praise that\
could be bestowed on any individual.\
\
I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on\
disconnectedly:\
\
\'93There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, _mon\
ami?_ There might have been? Yes\'94\'97his eyes wandered round the\
room\'97\'93this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did not yield much.\
Only this.\'94\
\
He pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket, and tossed it over to\
me. It was rather a curious document. A plain, dirty looking old\
envelope with a few words scrawled across it, apparently at random. The\
following is a facsimile of it.\
\
\
\
\

\

\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V. \'93IT ISN\'92T STRYCHNINE, IS IT?\'94\
\
\'93Where did you find this?\'94 I asked Poirot, in lively curiosity.\
\
\'93In the waste-paper basket. You recognise the handwriting?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s. But what does it mean?\'94\
\
Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\
\
\'93I cannot say\'97but it is suggestive.\'94\
\
A wild idea flashed across me. Was it possible that Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
mind was deranged? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal\
possession? And, if that were so, was it not also possible that she\
might have taken her own life?\
\
I was about to expound these theories to Poirot, when his own words\
distracted me.\
\
\'93Come,\'94 he said, \'93now to examine the coffee-cups!\'94\
\
\'93My dear Poirot! What on earth is the good of that, now that we know\
about the cocoa?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, _l\'e0 l\'e0!_ That miserable cocoa!\'94 cried Poirot flippantly.\
\
He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock\
despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.\
\
\'93And, anyway,\'94 I said, with increasing coldness, \'93as Mrs. Inglethorp\
took her coffee upstairs with her, I do not see what you expect to\
find, unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of\
strychnine on the coffee tray!\'94\
\
Poirot was sobered at once.\
\
\'93Come, come, my friend,\'94 he said, slipping his arms through mine. \'93_Ne\
vous f\'e2chez pas!_ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups, and I\
will respect your cocoa. There! Is it a bargain?\'94\
\
He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh; and we went\
together to the drawing-room, where the coffee-cups and tray remained\
undisturbed as we had left them.\
\
Poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before, listening\
very carefully, and verifying the position of the various cups.\
\
\'93So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray\'97and poured out. Yes. Then she came\
across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia. Yes. Here\
are the three cups. And the cup on the mantelpiece, half drunk, that\
would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\'92s. And the one on the tray?\'94\
\
\'93John Cavendish\'92s. I saw him put it down there.\'94\
\
\'93Good. One, two, three, four, five\'97but where, then, is the cup of Mr.\
Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93He does not take coffee.\'94\
\
\'93Then all are accounted for. One moment, my friend.\'94\
\
With infinite care, he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup,\
sealing them up in separate test tubes, tasting each in turn as he did\
so. His physiognomy underwent a curious change. An expression gathered\
there that I can only describe as half puzzled, and half relieved.\
\
\'93_Bien!_\'94 he said at last. \'93It is evident! I had an idea\'97but clearly I\
was mistaken. Yes, altogether I was mistaken. Yet it is strange. But no\
matter!\'94\
\
And, with a characteristic shrug, he dismissed whatever it was that was\
worrying him from his mind. I could have told him from the beginning\
that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind\
alley, but I restrained my tongue. After all, though he was old, Poirot\
had been a great man in his day.\
\
\'93Breakfast is ready,\'94 said John Cavendish, coming in from the hall.\
\'93You will breakfast with us, Monsieur Poirot?\'94\
\
Poirot acquiesced. I observed John. Already he was almost restored to\
his normal self. The shock of the events of the last night had upset\
him temporarily, but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal.\
He was a man of very little imagination, in sharp contrast with his\
brother, who had, perhaps, too much.\
\
Ever since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work,\
sending telegrams\'97one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard\'97writing\
notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the\
melancholy duties that a death entails.\
\
\'93May I ask how things are proceeding?\'94 he said. \'93Do your investigations\
point to my mother having died a natural death\'97or\'97or must we prepare\
ourselves for the worst?\'94\
\
\'93I think, Mr. Cavendish,\'94 said Poirot gravely, \'93that you would do well\
not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes. Can you tell me the views\
of the other members of the family?\'94\
\
\'93My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over\
nothing. He says that everything points to its being a simple case of\
heart failure.\'94\
\
\'93He does, does he? That is very interesting\'97very interesting,\'94 murmured\
Poirot softly. \'93And Mrs. Cavendish?\'94\
\
A faint cloud passed over John\'92s face.\
\
\'93I have not the least idea what my wife\'92s views on the subject are.\'94\
\
The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train. John broke the\
rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort:\
\
\'93I told you, didn\'92t I, that Mr. Inglethorp has returned?\'94\
\
Poirot bent his head.\
\
\'93It\'92s an awkward position for all of us. Of course one has to treat him\
as usual\'97but, hang it all, one\'92s gorge does rise at sitting down to eat\
with a possible murderer!\'94\
\
Poirot nodded sympathetically.\
\
\'93I quite understand. It is a very difficult situation for you, Mr.\
Cavendish. I would like to ask you one question. Mr. Inglethorp\'92s\
reason for not returning last night was, I believe, that he had\
forgotten the latch-key. Is not that so?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key _was_ forgotten\'97that\
he did not take it after all?\'94\
\
\'93I have no idea. I never thought of looking. We always keep it in the\
hall drawer. I\'92ll go and see if it\'92s there now.\'94\
\
Poirot held up his hand with a faint smile.\
\
\'93No, no, Mr. Cavendish, it is too late now. I am certain that you would\
find it. If Mr. Inglethorp did take it, he has had ample time to\
replace it by now.\'94\
\
\'93But do you think\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93I think nothing. If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his\
return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his\
favour. That is all.\'94\
\
John looked perplexed.\
\
\'93Do not worry,\'94 said Poirot smoothly. \'93I assure you that you need not\
let it trouble you. Since you are so kind, let us go and have some\
breakfast.\'94\
\
Everyone was assembled in the dining-room. Under the circumstances, we\
were naturally not a cheerful party. The reaction after a shock is\
always trying, and I think we were all suffering from it. Decorum and\
good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as\
usual, yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really\
a matter of great difficulty. There were no red eyes, no signs of\
secretly indulged grief. I felt that I was right in my opinion that\
Dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the\
tragedy.\
\
I pass over Alfred Inglethorp, who acted the bereaved widower in a\
manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy. Did he know that\
we suspected him, I wondered. Surely he could not be unaware of the\
fact, conceal it as we would. Did he feel some secret stirring of fear,\
or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished? Surely the\
suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked\
man.\
\
But did everyone suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched her\
as she sat at the head of the table, graceful, composed, enigmatic. In\
her soft grey frock, with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her\
slender hands, she looked very beautiful. When she chose, however, her\
face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability. She was very silent,\
hardly opening her lips, and yet in some queer way I felt that the\
great strength of her personality was dominating us all.\
\
And little Cynthia? Did she suspect? She looked very tired and ill, I\
thought. The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked. I\
asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly:\
\
\'93Yes, I\'92ve got the most beastly headache.\'94\
\
\'93Have another cup of coffee, mademoiselle?\'94 said Poirot solicitously.\
\'93It will revive you. It is unparalleled for the _mal de t\'eate_.\'94 He\
jumped up and took her cup.\
\
\'93No sugar,\'94 said Cynthia, watching him, as he picked up the\
sugar-tongs.\
\
\'93No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\'94\
\
\'93No, I never take it in coffee.\'94\
\
\'93_Sacr\'e9!_\'94 murmured Poirot to himself, as he brought back the\
replenished cup.\
\
Only I heard him, and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw\
that his face was working with suppressed excitement, and his eyes were\
as green as a cat\'92s. He had heard or seen something that had affected\
him strongly\'97but what was it? I do not usually label myself as dense,\
but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted _my_\
attention.\
\
In another moment, the door opened and Dorcas appeared.\
\
\'93Mr. Wells to see you, sir,\'94 she said to John.\
\
I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom Mrs.\
Inglethorp had written the night before.\
\
John rose immediately.\
\
\'93Show him into my study.\'94 Then he turned to us. \'93My mother\'92s lawyer,\'94\
he explained. And in a lower voice: \'93He is also Coroner\'97you understand.\
Perhaps you would like to come with me?\'94\
\
We acquiesced and followed him out of the room. John strode on ahead\
and I took the opportunity of whispering to Poirot:\
\
\'93There will be an inquest then?\'94\
\
Poirot nodded absently. He seemed absorbed in thought; so much so that\
my curiosity was aroused.\
\
\'93What is it? You are not attending to what I say.\'94\
\
\'93It is true, my friend. I am much worried.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee.\'94\
\
\'93What? You cannot be serious?\'94\
\
\'93But I am most serious. Ah, there is something there that I do not\
understand. My instinct was right.\'94\
\
\'93What instinct?\'94\
\
\'93The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups.\
_Chut!_ no more now!\'94\
\
We followed John into his study, and he closed the door behind us.\
\
Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the\
typical lawyer\'92s mouth. John introduced us both, and explained the\
reason of our presence.\
\
\'93You will understand, Wells,\'94 he added, \'93that this is all strictly\
private. We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for\
investigation of any kind.\'94\
\
\'93Quite so, quite so,\'94 said Mr. Wells soothingly. \'93I wish we could have\
spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest, but of course it\'92s\
quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor\'92s certificate.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I suppose so.\'94\
\
\'93Clever man, Bauerstein. Great authority on toxicology, I believe.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed,\'94 said John with a certain stiffness in his manner. Then he\
added rather hesitatingly: \'93Shall we have to appear as witnesses\'97all of\
us, I mean?\'94\
\
\'93You, of course\'97and ah\'97er\'97Mr.\'97er\'97Inglethorp.\'94\
\
A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner:\
\
\'93Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory, a mere matter of\
form.\'94\
\
\'93I see.\'94\
\
A faint expression of relief swept over John\'92s face. It puzzled me, for\
I saw no occasion for it.\
\
\'93If you know of nothing to the contrary,\'94 pursued Mr. Wells, \'93I had\
thought of Friday. That will give us plenty of time for the doctor\'92s\
report. The post-mortem is to take place to-night, I believe?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Then that arrangement will suit you?\'94\
\
\'93Perfectly.\'94\
\
\'93I need not tell you, my dear Cavendish, how distressed I am at this\
most tragic affair.\'94\
\
\'93Can you give us no help in solving it, monsieur?\'94 interposed Poirot,\
speaking for the first time since we had entered the room.\
\
\'93I?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night. You should\
have received the letter this morning.\'94\
\
\'93I did, but it contains no information. It is merely a note asking me\
to call upon her this morning, as she wanted my advice on a matter of\
great importance.\'94\
\
\'93She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be?\'94\
\
\'93Unfortunately, no.\'94\
\
\'93That is a pity,\'94 said John.\
\
\'93A great pity,\'94 agreed Poirot gravely.\
\
There was silence. Poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes.\
Finally he turned to the lawyer again.\
\
\'93Mr. Wells, there is one thing I should like to ask you\'97that is, if it\
is not against professional etiquette. In the event of Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s death, who would inherit her money?\'94\
\
The lawyer hesitated a moment, and then replied:\
\
\'93The knowledge will be public property very soon, so if Mr. Cavendish\
does not object\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Not at all,\'94 interpolated John.\
\
\'93I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question. By her\
last will, dated August of last year, after various unimportant\
legacies to servants, etc., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson,\
Mr. John Cavendish.\'94\
\
\'93Was not that\'97pardon the question, Mr. Cavendish\'97rather unfair to her\
other stepson, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish?\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not think so. You see, under the terms of their father\'92s\
will, while John inherited the property, Lawrence, at his stepmother\'92s\
death, would come into a considerable sum of money. Mrs. Inglethorp\
left her money to her elder stepson, knowing that he would have to keep\
up Styles. It was, to my mind, a very fair and equitable distribution.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded thoughtfully.\
\
\'93I see. But I am right in saying, am I not, that by your English law\
that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried?\'94\
\
Mr. Wells bowed his head.\
\
\'93As I was about to proceed, Monsieur Poirot, that document is now null\
and void.\'94\
\
\'93_Hein!_\'94 said Poirot. He reflected for a moment, and then asked: \'93Was\
Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact?\'94\
\
\'93I do not know. She may have been.\'94\
\
\'93She was,\'94 said John unexpectedly. \'93We were discussing the matter of\
wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! One more question, Mr. Wells. You say \'91her last will.\'92 Had Mrs.\
Inglethorp, then, made several former wills?\'94\
\
\'93On an average, she made a new will at least once a year,\'94 said Mr.\
Wells imperturbably. \'93She was given to changing her mind as to her\
testamentary dispositions, now benefiting one, now another member of\
her family.\'94\
\
\'93Suppose,\'94 suggested Poirot, \'93that, unknown to you, she had made a new\
will in favour of someone who was not, in any sense of the word, a\
member of the family\'97we will say Miss Howard, for instance\'97would you be\
surprised?\'94\
\
\'93Not in the least.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 Poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions.\
\
I drew close to him, while John and the lawyer were debating the\
question of going through Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s papers.\
\
\'93Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss\
Howard?\'94 I asked in a low voice, with some curiosity.\
\
Poirot smiled.\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Then why did you ask?\'94\
\
\'93Hush!\'94\
\
John Cavendish had turned to Poirot.\
\
\'93Will you come with us, Monsieur Poirot? We are going through my\
mother\'92s papers. Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely\
to Mr. Wells and myself.\'94\
\
\'93Which simplifies matters very much,\'94 murmured the lawyer. \'93As\
technically, of course, he was entitled\'97\'97\'94 He did not finish the\
sentence.\
\
\'93We will look through the desk in the boudoir first,\'94 explained John,\
\'93and go up to her bedroom afterwards. She kept her most important\
papers in a purple despatch-case, which we must look through\
carefully.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said the lawyer, \'93it is quite possible that there may be a later\
will than the one in my possession.\'94\
\
\'93There _is_ a later will.\'94 It was Poirot who spoke.\
\
\'93What?\'94 John and the lawyer looked at him startled.\
\
\'93Or, rather,\'94 pursued my friend imperturbably, \'93there _was_ one.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean\'97there was one? Where is it now?\'94\
\
\'93Burnt!\'94\
\
\'93Burnt?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. See here.\'94 He took out the charred fragment we had found in the\
grate in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room, and handed it to the lawyer with a\
brief explanation of when and where he had found it.\
\
\'93But possibly this is an old will?\'94\
\
\'93I do not think so. In fact I am almost certain that it was made no\
earlier than yesterday afternoon.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 \'93Impossible!\'94 broke simultaneously from both men.\
\
Poirot turned to John.\
\
\'93If you will allow me to send for your gardener, I will prove it to\
you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, of course\'97but I don\'92t see\'97\'97\'94\
\
Poirot raised his hand.\
\
\'93Do as I ask you. Afterwards you shall question as much as you please.\'94\
\
\'93Very well.\'94 He rang the bell.\
\
Dorcas answered it in due course.\
\
\'93Dorcas, will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
Dorcas withdrew.\
\
We waited in a tense silence. Poirot alone seemed perfectly at his\
ease, and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase.\
\
The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the\
approach of Manning. John looked questioningly at Poirot. The latter\
nodded.\
\
\'93Come inside, Manning,\'94 said John, \'93I want to speak to you.\'94\
\
Manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window, and\
stood as near it as he could. He held his cap in his hands, twisting it\
very carefully round and round. His back was much bent, though he was\
probably not as old as he looked, but his eyes were sharp and\
intelligent, and belied his slow and rather cautious speech.\
\
\'93Manning,\'94 said John, \'93this gentleman will put some questions to you\
which I want you to answer.\'94\
\
\'93Yessir,\'94 mumbled Manning.\
\
Poirot stepped forward briskly. Manning\'92s eye swept over him with a\
faint contempt.\
\
\'93You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the\
house yesterday afternoon, were you not, Manning?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, me and Willum.\'94\
\
\'93And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, she did.\'94\
\
\'93Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that.\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir, nothing much. She just told Willum to go on his bicycle\
down to the village, and bring back a form of will, or such-like\'97I\
don\'92t know what exactly\'97she wrote it down for him.\'94\
\
\'93Well?\'94\
\
\'93Well, he did, sir.\'94\
\
\'93And what happened next?\'94\
\
\'93We went on with the begonias, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, both me and Willum, she called.\'94\
\
\'93And then?\'94\
\
\'93She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long\
paper\'97under where she\'92d signed.\'94\
\
\'93Did you see anything of what was written above her signature?\'94 asked\
Poirot sharply.\
\
\'93No, sir, there was a bit of blotting paper over that part.\'94\
\
\'93And you signed where she told you?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, first me and then Willum.\'94\
\
\'93What did she do with it afterwards?\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir, she slipped it into a long envelope, and put it inside a\
sort of purple box that was standing on the desk.\'94\
\
\'93What time was it when she first called you?\'94\
\
\'93About four, I should say, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Not earlier? Couldn\'92t it have been about half-past three?\'94\
\
\'93No, I shouldn\'92t say so, sir. It would be more likely to be a bit after\
four\'97not before it.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, Manning, that will do,\'94 said Poirot pleasantly.\
\
The gardener glanced at his master, who nodded, whereupon Manning\
lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble, and backed\
cautiously out of the window.\
\
We all looked at each other.\
\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 murmured John. \'93What an extraordinary coincidence.\'94\
\
\'93How\'97a coincidence?\'94\
\
\'93That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death!\'94\
\
Mr. Wells cleared his throat and remarked drily:\
\
\'93Are you so sure it is a coincidence, Cavendish?\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94\
\
\'93Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with\'97someone yesterday\
afternoon\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94 cried John again. There was a tremor in his voice,\
and he had gone very pale.\
\
\'93In consequence of that quarrel, your mother very suddenly and\
hurriedly makes a new will. The contents of that will we shall never\
know. She told no one of its provisions. This morning, no doubt, she\
would have consulted me on the subject\'97but she had no chance. The will\
disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave. Cavendish,\
I much fear there is no coincidence there. Monsieur Poirot, I am sure\
you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive.\'94\
\
\'93Suggestive, or not,\'94 interrupted John, \'93we are most grateful to\
Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, we should\
never have known of this will. I suppose, I may not ask you, monsieur,\
what first led you to suspect the fact?\'94\
\
Poirot smiled and answered:\
\
\'93A scribbled over old envelope, and a freshly planted bed of begonias.\'94\
\
John, I think, would have pressed his questions further, but at that\
moment the loud purr of a motor was audible, and we all turned to the\
window as it swept past.\
\
\'93Evie!\'94 cried John. \'93Excuse me, Wells.\'94 He went hurriedly out into the\
hall.\
\
Poirot looked inquiringly at me.\
\
\'93Miss Howard,\'94 I explained.\
\
\'93Ah, I am glad she has come. There is a woman with a head and a heart\
too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!\'94\
\
I followed John\'92s example, and went out into the hall, where Miss\
Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass\
of veils that enveloped her head. As her eyes fell on me, a sudden pang\
of guilt shot through me. This was the woman who had warned me so\
earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed! How soon,\
and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind. Now that she\
had been proved justified in so tragic a manner, I felt ashamed. She\
had known Alfred Inglethorp only too well. I wondered whether, if she\
had remained at Styles, the tragedy would have taken place, or would\
the man have feared her watchful eyes?\
\
I was relieved when she shook me by the hand, with her well remembered\
painful grip. The eyes that met mine were sad, but not reproachful;\
that she had been crying bitterly, I could tell by the redness of her\
eyelids, but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness.\
\
\'93Started the moment I got the wire. Just come off night duty. Hired\
car. Quickest way to get here.\'94\
\
\'93Have you had anything to eat this morning, Evie?\'94 asked John.\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93I thought not. Come along, breakfast\'92s not cleared away yet, and\
they\'92ll make you some fresh tea.\'94 He turned to me. \'93Look after her,\
Hastings, will you? Wells is waiting for me. Oh, here\'92s Monsieur\
Poirot. He\'92s helping us, you know, Evie.\'94\
\
Miss Howard shook hands with Poirot, but glanced suspiciously over her\
shoulder at John.\
\
\'93What do you mean\'97helping us?\'94\
\
\'93Helping us to investigate.\'94\
\
\'93Nothing to investigate. Have they taken him to prison yet?\'94\
\
\'93Taken who to prison?\'94\
\
\'93Who? Alfred Inglethorp, of course!\'94\
\
\'93My dear Evie, do be careful. Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother\
died from heart seizure.\'94\
\
\'93More fool, Lawrence!\'94 retorted Miss Howard. \'93Of course Alfred\
Inglethorp murdered poor Emily\'97as I always told you he would.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Evie, don\'92t shout so. Whatever we may think or suspect, it is\
better to say as little as possible for the present. The inquest isn\'92t\
until Friday.\'94\
\
\'93Not until fiddlesticks!\'94 The snort Miss Howard gave was truly\
magnificent. \'93You\'92re all off your heads. The man will be out of the\
country by then. If he\'92s any sense, he won\'92t stay here tamely and wait\
to be hanged.\'94\
\
John Cavendish looked at her helplessly.\
\
\'93I know what it is,\'94 she accused him, \'93you\'92ve been listening to the\
doctors. Never should. What do they know? Nothing at all\'97or just enough\
to make them dangerous. I ought to know\'97my own father was a doctor.\
That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever\
seen. Heart seizure! Sort of thing he would say. Anyone with any sense\
could see at once that her husband had poisoned her. I always said he\'92d\
murder her in her bed, poor soul. Now he\'92s done it. And all you can do\
is to murmur silly things about \'91heart seizure\'92 and \'91inquest on\
Friday.\'92 You ought to be ashamed of yourself, John Cavendish.\'94\
\
\'93What do you want me to do?\'94 asked John, unable to help a faint smile.\
\'93Dash it all, Evie, I can\'92t haul him down to the local police station\
by the scruff of his neck.\'94\
\
\'93Well, you might do something. Find out how he did it. He\'92s a crafty\
beggar. Dare say he soaked fly papers. Ask cook if she\'92s missed any.\'94\
\
It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour Miss\
Howard and Alfred Inglethorp under the same roof, and keep the peace\
between them, was likely to prove a Herculean task, and I did not envy\
John. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully\
appreciated the difficulty of the position. For the moment, he sought\
refuge in retreat, and left the room precipitately.\
\
Dorcas brought in fresh tea. As she left the room, Poirot came over\
from the window where he had been standing, and sat down facing Miss\
Howard.\
\
\'93Mademoiselle,\'94 he said gravely, \'93I want to ask you something.\'94\
\
\'93Ask away,\'94 said the lady, eyeing him with some disfavour.\
\
\'93I want to be able to count upon your help.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92ll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure,\'94 she replied gruffly.\
\'93Hanging\'92s too good for him. Ought to be drawn and quartered, like in\
good old times.\'94\
\
\'93We are at one then,\'94 said Poirot, \'93for I, too, want to hang the\
criminal.\'94\
\
\'93Alfred Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93Him, or another.\'94\
\
\'93No question of another. Poor Emily was never murdered until _he_ came\
along. I don\'92t say she wasn\'92t surrounded by sharks\'97she was. But it was\
only her purse they were after. Her life was safe enough. But along\
comes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp\'97and within two months\'97hey presto!\'94\
\
\'93Believe me, Miss Howard,\'94 said Poirot very earnestly, \'93if Mr.\
Inglethorp is the man, he shall not escape me. On my honour, I will\
hang him as high as Haman!\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s better,\'94 said Miss Howard more enthusiastically.\
\
\'93But I must ask you to trust me. Now your help may be very valuable to\
me. I will tell you why. Because, in all this house of mourning, yours\
are the only eyes that have wept.\'94\
\
Miss Howard blinked, and a new note crept into the gruffness of her\
voice.\
\
\'93If you mean that I was fond of her\'97yes, I was. You know, Emily was a\
selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always\
wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for\
them\'97and, that way she missed love. Don\'92t think she ever realized it,\
though, or felt the lack of it. Hope not, anyway. I was on a different\
footing. I took my stand from the first. \'91So many pounds a year I\'92m\
worth to you. Well and good. But not a penny piece besides\'97not a pair\
of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.\'92 She didn\'92t understand\'97was very\
offended sometimes. Said I was foolishly proud. It wasn\'92t that\'97but I\
couldn\'92t explain. Anyway, I kept my self-respect. And so, out of the\
whole bunch, I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of\
her. I watched over her. I guarded her from the lot of them, and then a\
glib-tongued scoundrel comes along, and pooh! all my years of devotion\
go for nothing.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded sympathetically.\
\
\'93I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel. It is most\
natural. You think that we are lukewarm\'97that we lack fire and\
energy\'97but trust me, it is not so.\'94\
\
John stuck his head in at this juncture, and invited us both to come up\
to Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room, as he and Mr. Wells had finished looking\
through the desk in the boudoir.\
\
As we went up the stairs, John looked back to the dining-room door, and\
lowered his voice confidentially:\
\
\'93Look here, what\'92s going to happen when these two meet?\'94\
\
I shook my head helplessly.\
\
\'93I\'92ve told Mary to keep them apart if she can.\'94\
\
\'93Will she be able to do so?\'94\
\
\'93The Lord only knows. There\'92s one thing, Inglethorp himself won\'92t be\
too keen on meeting her.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ve got the keys still, haven\'92t you, Poirot?\'94 I asked, as we\
reached the door of the locked room.\
\
Taking the keys from Poirot, John unlocked it, and we all passed in.\
The lawyer went straight to the desk, and John followed him.\
\
\'93My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case, I\
believe,\'94 he said.\
\
Poirot drew out the small bunch of keys.\
\
\'93Permit me. I locked it, out of precaution, this morning.\'94\
\
\'93But it\'92s not locked now.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94\
\
\'93See.\'94 And John lifted the lid as he spoke.\
\
\'93_Milles tonnerres!_\'94 cried Poirot, dumbfounded. \'93And I\'97who have both\
the keys in my pocket!\'94 He flung himself upon the case. Suddenly he\
stiffened. \'93_Eh voil\'e0 une affaire!_ This lock has been forced.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
Poirot laid down the case again.\
\
\'93But who forced it? Why should they? When? But the door was locked?\'94\
These exclamations burst from us disjointedly.\
\
Poirot answered them categorically\'97almost mechanically.\
\
\'93Who? That is the question. Why? Ah, if I only knew. When? Since I was\
here an hour ago. As to the door being locked, it is a very ordinary\
lock. Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it.\'94\
\
We stared at one another blankly. Poirot had walked over to the\
mantelpiece. He was outwardly calm, but I noticed his hands, which from\
long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on\
the mantelpiece, were shaking violently.\
\
\'93See here, it was like this,\'94 he said at last. \'93There was something in\
that case\'97some piece of evidence, slight in itself perhaps, but still\
enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime. It was vital\
to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its\
significance appreciated. Therefore, he took the risk, the great risk,\
of coming in here. Finding the case locked, he was obliged to force it,\
thus betraying his presence. For him to take that risk, it must have\
been something of great importance.\'94\
\
\'93But what was it?\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 cried Poirot, with a gesture of anger. \'93That, I do not know! A\
document of some kind, without doubt, possibly the scrap of paper\
Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon. And I\'97\'94 his anger burst\
forth freely\'97\'93miserable animal that I am! I guessed nothing! I have\
behaved like an imbecile! I should never have left that case here. I\
should have carried it away with me. Ah, triple pig! And now it is\
gone. It is destroyed\'97but is it destroyed? Is there not yet a chance\'97we\
must leave no stone unturned\'97\'94\
\
He rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I\
had sufficiently recovered my wits. But, by the time I had reached the\
top of the stairs, he was out of sight.\
\
Mary Cavendish was standing where the staircase branched, staring down\
into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared.\
\
\'93What has happened to your extraordinary little friend, Mr. Hastings?\
He has just rushed past me like a mad bull.\'94\
\
\'93He\'92s rather upset about something,\'94 I remarked feebly. I really did\
not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose. As I saw a faint\
smile gather on Mrs. Cavendish\'92s expressive mouth, I endeavoured to try\
and turn the conversation by saying: \'93They haven\'92t met yet, have they?\'94\
\
\'93Who?\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard.\'94\
\
She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner.\
\
\'93Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet?\'94\
\
\'93Well, don\'92t you?\'94 I said, rather taken aback.\
\
\'93No.\'94 She was smiling in her quiet way. \'93I should like to see a good\
flare up. It would clear the air. At present we are all thinking so\
much, and saying so little.\'94\
\
\'93John doesn\'92t think so,\'94 I remarked. \'93He\'92s anxious to keep them apart.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, John!\'94\
\
Something in her tone fired me, and I blurted out:\
\
\'93Old John\'92s an awfully good sort.\'94\
\
She studied me curiously for a minute or two, and then said, to my\
great surprise:\
\
\'93You are loyal to your friend. I like you for that.\'94\
\
\'93Aren\'92t you my friend too?\'94\
\
\'93I am a very bad friend.\'94\
\
\'93Why do you say that?\'94\
\
\'93Because it is true. I am charming to my friends one day, and forget\
all about them the next.\'94\
\
I don\'92t know what impelled me, but I was nettled, and I said foolishly\
and not in the best of taste:\
\
\'93Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein!\'94\
\
Instantly I regretted my words. Her face stiffened. I had the\
impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real\
woman. Without a word, she turned and went swiftly up the stairs,\
whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her.\
\
I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below. I\
could hear Poirot shouting and expounding. I was vexed to think that my\
diplomacy had been in vain. The little man appeared to be taking the\
whole house into his confidence, a proceeding of which I, for one,\
doubted the wisdom. Once again I could not help regretting that my\
friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement. I\
stepped briskly down the stairs. The sight of me calmed Poirot almost\
immediately. I drew him aside.\
\
\'93My dear fellow,\'94 I said, \'93is this wise? Surely you don\'92t want the\
whole house to know of this occurrence? You are actually playing into\
the criminal\'92s hands.\'94\
\
\'93You think so, Hastings?\'94\
\
\'93I am sure of it.\'94\
\
\'93Well, well, my friend, I will be guided by you.\'94\
\
\'93Good. Although, unfortunately, it is a little too late now.\'94\
\
\'93Sure.\'94\
\
He looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry, though I\
still thought my rebuke a just and wise one.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 he said at last, \'93let us go, _mon ami_.\'94\
\
\'93You have finished here?\'94\
\
\'93For the moment, yes. You will walk back with me to the village?\'94\
\
\'93Willingly.\'94\
\
He picked up his little suit-case, and we went out through the open\
window in the drawing-room. Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and\
Poirot stood aside to let her pass.\
\
\'93Excuse me, mademoiselle, one minute.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94 she turned inquiringly.\
\
\'93Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s medicines?\'94\
\
A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly:\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Only her powders?\'94\
\
The flush deepened as Cynthia replied:\
\
\'93Oh, yes, I did make up some sleeping powders for her once.\'94\
\
\'93These?\'94\
\
Poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders.\
\
She nodded.\
\
\'93Can you tell me what they were? Sulphonal? Veronal?\'94\
\
\'93No, they were bromide powders.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! Thank you, mademoiselle; good morning.\'94\
\
As we walked briskly away from the house, I glanced at him more than\
once. I had often before noticed that, if anything excited him, his\
eyes turned green like a cat\'92s. They were shining like emeralds now.\
\
\'93My friend,\'94 he broke out at last, \'93I have a little idea, a very\
strange, and probably utterly impossible idea. And yet\'97it fits in.\'94\
\
I shrugged my shoulders. I privately thought that Poirot was rather too\
much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, the truth\
was only too plain and apparent.\
\
\'93So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box,\'94 I remarked.\
\'93Very simple, as you said. I really wonder that I did not think of it\
myself.\'94\
\
Poirot did not appear to be listening to me.\
\
\'93They have made one more discovery, _l\'e0-bas_,\'94 he observed, jerking his\
thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles. \'93Mr. Wells told me\
as we were going upstairs.\'94\
\
\'93What was it?\'94\
\
\'93Locked up in the desk in the boudoir, they found a will of Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s, dated before her marriage, leaving her fortune to Alfred\
Inglethorp. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.\
It came quite as a surprise to Wells\'97and to John Cavendish also. It was\
written on one of those printed will forms, and witnessed by two of the\
servants\'97not Dorcas.\'94\
\
\'93Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it?\'94\
\
\'93He says not.\'94\
\
\'93One might take that with a grain of salt,\'94 I remarked sceptically.\
\'93All these wills are very confusing. Tell me, how did those scribbled\
words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made\
yesterday afternoon?\'94\
\
Poirot smiled.\
\
\'93_Mon ami_, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the\
fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, often. I suppose everyone has.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or\
twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to\
see if it looked right? Well, that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did. You\
will notice that the word \'91possessed\'92 is spelt first with one \'91s\'92 and\
subsequently with two\'97correctly. To make sure, she had further tried it\
in a sentence, thus: \'91I am possessed.\'92 Now, what did that tell me? It\
told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word \'91possessed\'92 that\
afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh\
in my mind, the possibility of a will\'97(a document almost certain to\
contain that word)\'97occurred to me at once. This possibility was\
confirmed by a further circumstance. In the general confusion, the\
boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several\
traces of brown mould and earth. The weather had been perfectly fine\
for some days, and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy\
deposit.\
\
\'93I strolled to the window, and saw at once that the begonia beds had\
been newly planted. The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that\
on the floor of the boudoir, and also I learnt from you that they _had_\
been planted yesterday afternoon. I was now sure that one, or possibly\
both of the gardeners\'97for there were two sets of footprints in the\
bed\'97had entered the boudoir, for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished\
to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window,\
and they would not have come into the room at all. I was now quite\
convinced that she had made a fresh will, and had called the two\
gardeners in to witness her signature. Events proved that I was right\
in my supposition.\'94\
\
\'93That was very ingenious,\'94 I could not help admitting. \'93I must confess\
that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite\
erroneous.\'94\
\
He smiled.\
\
\'93You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good\
servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most\
likely.\'94\
\
\'93Another point\'97how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had\
been lost?\'94\
\
\'93I did not know it. It was a guess that turned out to be correct. You\
observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle. That\
suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy\
key-ring. Now, if it had been lost and recovered, Mrs. Inglethorp would\
at once have replaced it on her bunch; but on her bunch I found what\
was obviously the duplicate key, very new and bright, which led me to\
the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the\
lock of the despatch-case.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I said, \'93Alfred Inglethorp, without doubt.\'94\
\
Poirot looked at me curiously.\
\
\'93You are very sure of his guilt?\'94\
\
\'93Well, naturally. Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more\
clearly.\'94\
\
\'93On the contrary,\'94 said Poirot quietly, \'93there are several points in\
his favour.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, come now!\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93I see only one.\'94\
\
\'93And that?\'94\
\
\'93That he was not in the house last night.\'94\
\
\'93\'91Bad shot!\'92 as you English say! You have chosen the one point that to\
my mind tells against him.\'94\
\
\'93How is that?\'94\
\
\'93Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last\
night, he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house. His\
excuse was an obviously trumped up one. That leaves us two\
possibilities: either he knew what was going to happen or he had a\
reason of his own for his absence.\'94\
\
\'93And that reason?\'94 I asked sceptically.\
\
Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\
\
\'93How should I know? Discreditable, without doubt. This Mr. Inglethorp,\
I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel\'97but that does not of necessity\
make him a murderer.\'94\
\
I shook my head, unconvinced.\
\
\'93We do not agree, eh?\'94 said Poirot. \'93Well, let us leave it. Time will\
show which of us is right. Now let us turn to other aspects of the\
case. What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom\
were bolted on the inside?\'94\
\
\'93Well\'97\'97\'94 I considered. \'93One must look at it logically.\'94\
\
\'93True.\'94\
\
\'93I should put it this way. The doors _were_ bolted\'97our own eyes have\
told us that\'97yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor, and\
the destruction of the will, prove that during the night someone\
entered the room. You agree so far?\'94\
\
\'93Perfectly. Put with admirable clearness. Proceed.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I said, encouraged, \'93as the person who entered did not do so by\
the window, nor by miraculous means, it follows that the door must have\
been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself. That strengthens\
the conviction that the person in question was her husband. She would\
naturally open the door to her own husband.\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head.\
\
\'93Why should she? She had bolted the door leading into his room\'97a most\
unusual proceeding on her part\'97she had had a most violent quarrel with\
him that very afternoon. No, he was the last person she would admit.\'94\
\
\'93But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs.\
Inglethorp herself?\'94\
\
\'93There is another possibility. She may have forgotten to bolt the door\
into the passage when she went to bed, and have got up later, towards\
morning, and bolted it then.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot, is that seriously your opinion?\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not say it is so, but it might be. Now, to turn to another\
feature, what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard\
between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother-in-law?\'94\
\
\'93I had forgotten that,\'94 I said thoughtfully. \'93That is as enigmatical as\
ever. It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish, proud and\
reticent to the last degree, should interfere so violently in what was\
certainly not her affair.\'94\
\
\'93Precisely. It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to\
do.\'94\
\
\'93It is certainly curious,\'94 I agreed. \'93Still, it is unimportant, and\
need not be taken into account.\'94\
\
A groan burst from Poirot.\
\
\'93What have I always told you? Everything must be taken into account. If\
the fact will not fit the theory\'97let the theory go.\'94\
\
\'93Well, we shall see,\'94 I said, nettled.\
\
\'93Yes, we shall see.\'94\
\
We had reached Leastways Cottage, and Poirot ushered me upstairs to his\
own room. He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself\
occasionally smoked. I was amused to notice that he stowed away the\
used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary\
annoyance vanished.\
\
Poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which\
commanded a view of the village street. The fresh air blew in warm and\
pleasant. It was going to be a hot day.\
\
Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing\
down the street at a great pace. It was the expression on his face that\
was extraordinary\'97a curious mingling of terror and agitation.\
\
\'93Look, Poirot!\'94 I said.\
\
He leant forward.\
\
\'93_Tiens!_\'94 he said. \'93It is Mr. Mace, from the chemist\'92s shop. He is\
coming here.\'94\
\
The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage, and, after\
hesitating a moment, pounded vigorously at the door.\
\
\'93A little minute,\'94 cried Poirot from the window. \'93I come.\'94\
\
Motioning to me to follow him, he ran swiftly down the stairs and\
opened the door. Mr. Mace began at once.\
\
\'93Oh, Mr. Poirot, I\'92m sorry for the inconvenience, but I heard that\
you\'92d just come back from the Hall?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, we have.\'94\
\
The young man moistened his dry lips. His face was working curiously.\
\
\'93It\'92s all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly.\
They do say\'97\'94 he lowered his voice cautiously\'97\'93that it\'92s poison?\'94\
\
Poirot\'92s face remained quite impassive.\
\
\'93Only the doctors can tell us that, Mr. Mace.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, exactly\'97of course\'97\'97\'94 The young man hesitated, and then his\
agitation was too much for him. He clutched Poirot by the arm, and sank\
his voice to a whisper: \'93Just tell me this, Mr. Poirot, it isn\'92t\'97it\
isn\'92t strychnine, is it?\'94\
\
I hardly heard what Poirot replied. Something evidently of a\
non-committal nature. The young man departed, and as he closed the door\
Poirot\'92s eyes met mine.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he said, nodding gravely. \'93He will have evidence to give at the\
inquest.\'94\
\
We went slowly upstairs again. I was opening my lips, when Poirot\
stopped me with a gesture of his hand.\
\
\'93Not now, not now, _mon ami_. I have need of reflection. My mind is in\
some disorder\'97which is not well.\'94\
\
For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence, perfectly still, except\
for several expressive motions of his eyebrows, and all the time his\
eyes grew steadily greener. At last he heaved a deep sigh.\
\
\'93It is well. The bad moment has passed. Now all is arranged and\
classified. One must never permit confusion. The case is not clear\
yet\'97no. For it is of the most complicated! It puzzles _me_. _Me_,\
Hercule Poirot! There are two facts of significance.\'94\
\
\'93And what are they?\'94\
\
\'93The first is the state of the weather yesterday. That is very\
important.\'94\
\
\'93But it was a glorious day!\'94 I interrupted. \'93Poirot, you\'92re pulling my\
leg!\'94\
\
\'93Not at all. The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade. Do not\
forget that, my friend. It is the key to the whole riddle!\'94\
\
\'93And the second point?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar\
clothes, has a black beard, and uses glasses.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot, I cannot believe you are serious.\'94\
\
\'93I am absolutely serious, my friend.\'94\
\
\'93But this is childish!\'94\
\
\'93No, it is very momentous.\'94\
\
\'93And supposing the Coroner\'92s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder\
against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of your theories, then?\'94\
\
\'93They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to\
make a mistake! But that will not occur. For one thing, a country jury\
is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself, and Mr. Inglethorp\
stands practically in the position of local squire. Also,\'94 he added\
placidly, \'93_I_ should not allow it!\'94\
\
\'93_You_ would not allow it?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
I looked at the extraordinary little man, divided between annoyance and\
amusement. He was so tremendously sure of himself. As though he read my\
thoughts, he nodded gently.\
\
\'93Oh, yes, _mon ami_, I would do what I say.\'94 He got up and laid his\
hand on my shoulder. His physiognomy underwent a complete change. Tears\
came into his eyes. \'93In all this, you see, I think of that poor Mrs.\
Inglethorp who is dead. She was not extravagantly loved\'97no. But she was\
very good to us Belgians\'97I owe her a debt.\'94\
\
I endeavoured to interrupt, but Poirot swept on.\
\
\'93Let me tell you this, Hastings. She would never forgive me if I let\
Alfred Inglethorp, her husband, be arrested _now_\'97when a word from me\
could save him!\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI. THE INQUEST\
\
In the interval before the inquest, Poirot was unfailing in his\
activity. Twice he was closeted with Mr. Wells. He also took long walks\
into the country. I rather resented his not taking me into his\
confidence, the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was\
driving at.\
\
It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes\'92s\
farm; so, finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on\
Wednesday evening, I walked over there by the fields, hoping to meet\
him. But there was no sign of him, and I hesitated to go right up to\
the farm itself. As I walked away, I met an aged rustic, who leered at\
me cunningly.\
\
\'93You\'92m from the Hall, bain\'92t you?\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93Yes. I\'92m looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked\
this way.\'94\
\
\'93A little chap? As waves his hands when he talks? One of them Belgies\
from the village?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I said eagerly. \'93He has been here, then?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, ay, he\'92s been here, right enough. More\'92n once too. Friend of\
yours, is he? Ah, you gentlemen from the Hall\'97you\'92m a pretty lot!\'94 And\
he leered more jocosely than ever.\
\
\'93Why, do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often?\'94 I asked, as\
carelessly as I could.\
\
He winked at me knowingly.\
\
\'93_One_ does, mister. Naming no names, mind. And a very liberal\
gentleman too! Oh, thank you, sir, I\'92m sure.\'94\
\
I walked on sharply. Evelyn Howard had been right then, and I\
experienced a sharp twinge of disgust, as I thought of Alfred\
Inglethorp\'92s liberality with another woman\'92s money. Had that piquant\
gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime, or was it the baser\
mainspring of money? Probably a judicious mixture of both.\
\
On one point, Poirot seemed to have a curious obsession. He once or\
twice observed to me that he thought Dorcas must have made an error in\
fixing the time of the quarrel. He suggested to her repeatedly that it\
was four-thirty, and not four o\'92clock when she had heard the voices.\
\
But Dorcas was unshaken. Quite an hour, or even more, had elapsed\
between the time when she had heard the voices and five o\'92clock, when\
she had taken tea to her mistress.\
\
The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village.\
Poirot and I sat together, not being required to give evidence.\
\
The preliminaries were gone through. The jury viewed the body, and John\
Cavendish gave evidence of identification.\
\
Further questioned, he described his awakening in the early hours of\
the morning, and the circumstances of his mother\'92s death.\
\
The medical evidence was next taken. There was a breathless hush, and\
every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist, who was known to\
be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of\
toxicology.\
\
In a few brief words, he summed up the result of the post-mortem. Shorn\
of its medical phraseology and technicalities, it amounted to the fact\
that Mrs. Inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine\
poisoning. Judging from the quantity recovered, she must have taken not\
less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine, but probably one\
grain or slightly over.\
\
\'93Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident?\'94\
asked the Coroner.\
\
\'93I should consider it very unlikely. Strychnine is not used for\
domestic purposes, as some poisons are, and there are restrictions\
placed on its sale.\'94\
\
\'93Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison\
was administered?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?\'94\
\
\'93That is so. The motor met me just outside the lodge gates, and I\
hurried there as fast as I could.\'94\
\
\'93Will you relate to us exactly what happened next?\'94\
\
\'93I entered Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room. She was at that moment in a typical\
tetanic convulsion. She turned towards me, and gasped out:\
\'91Alfred\'97Alfred\'97\'97\'92\'94\
\
\'93Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband?\'94\
\
\'93Possibly, but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action. The\
symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed. It\
is retarded under certain conditions, none of which, however, appear to\
have been present in this case. I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the\
coffee after dinner about eight o\'92clock, whereas the symptoms did not\
manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning, which, on the\
face of it, points to the drug having been taken much later in the\
evening.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the\
middle of the night. Could the strychnine have been administered in\
that?\'94\
\
\'93No, I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and\
had it analysed. There was no strychnine present.\'94\
\
I heard Poirot chuckle softly beside me.\
\
\'93How did you know?\'94 I whispered.\
\
\'93Listen.\'94\
\
\'93I should say\'94\'97the doctor was continuing\'97\'93that I would have been\
considerably surprised at any other result.\'94\
\
\'93Why?\'94\
\
\'93Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste. It can be\
detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand, and can only be\
disguised by some strongly flavoured substance. Cocoa would be quite\
powerless to mask it.\'94\
\
One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee.\
\
\'93No. Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover\
the taste of strychnine.\'94\
\
\'93Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the\
coffee, but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but, the cup being completely smashed, there is no possibility of\
analyzing its contents.\'94\
\
This concluded Dr. Bauerstein\'92s evidence. Dr. Wilkins corroborated it\
on all points. Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated\
it utterly. The deceased, he said, suffered from a weak heart, but\
otherwise enjoyed perfect health, and was of a cheerful and\
well-balanced disposition. She would be one of the last people to take\
her own life.\
\
Lawrence Cavendish was next called. His evidence was quite unimportant,\
being a mere repetition of that of his brother. Just as he was about to\
step down, he paused, and said rather hesitatingly:\
\
\'93I should like to make a suggestion if I may?\'94\
\
He glanced deprecatingly at the Coroner, who replied briskly:\
\
\'93Certainly, Mr. Cavendish, we are here to arrive at the truth of this\
matter, and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation.\'94\
\
\'93It is just an idea of mine,\'94 explained Lawrence. \'93Of course I may be\
quite wrong, but it still seems to me that my mother\'92s death might be\
accounted for by natural means.\'94\
\
\'93How do you make that out, Mr. Cavendish?\'94\
\
\'93My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was\
taking a tonic containing strychnine.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 said the Coroner.\
\
The jury looked up, interested.\
\
\'93I believe,\'94 continued Lawrence, \'93that there have been cases where the\
cumulative effect of a drug, administered for some time, has ended by\
causing death. Also, is it not possible that she may have taken an\
overdose of her medicine by accident?\'94\
\
\'93This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at\
the time of her death. We are much obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish.\'94\
\
Dr. Wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea.\
\
\'93What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible. Any doctor would tell\
you the same. Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison,\
but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in\
this way. There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms\
which would at once have attracted my attention. The whole thing is\
absurd.\'94\
\
\'93And the second suggestion? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently\
taken an overdose?\'94\
\
\'93Three, or even four doses, would not have resulted in death. Mrs.\
Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a\
time, as she dealt with Coot\'92s, the Cash Chemists in Tadminster. She\
would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the\
amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem.\'94\
\
\'93Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any\
way instrumental in causing her death?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly. The supposition is ridiculous.\'94\
\
The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the\
chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error.\
\
\'93That, of course, is always possible,\'94 replied the doctor.\
\
But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that\
possibility. The medicine had not been newly made up. On the contrary,\
Mrs. Inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death.\
\
So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned, and the Coroner\
proceeded with his task. Having elicited from Dorcas how she had been\
awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress\'92s bell, and had\
subsequently roused the household, he passed to the subject of the\
quarrel on the preceding afternoon.\
\
Dorcas\'92s evidence on this point was substantially what Poirot and I had\
already heard, so I will not repeat it here.\
\
The next witness was Mary Cavendish. She stood very upright, and spoke\
in a low, clear, and perfectly composed voice. In answer to the\
Coroner\'92s question, she told how, her alarm clock having aroused her at\
four-thirty as usual, she was dressing, when she was startled by the\
sound of something heavy falling.\
\
\'93That would have been the table by the bed?\'94 commented the Coroner.\
\
\'93I opened my door,\'94 continued Mary, \'93and listened. In a few minutes a\
bell rang violently. Dorcas came running down and woke my husband, and\
we all went to my mother-in-law\'92s room, but it was locked\'97\'97\'94\
\
The Coroner interrupted her.\
\
\'93I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point. We\
know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings. But I should\
be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the\
day before.\'94\
\
\'93I?\'94\
\
There was a faint insolence in her voice. She raised her hand and\
adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck, turning her head a little as\
she did so. And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind:\
\'93She is gaining time!\'94\
\
\'93Yes. I understand,\'94 continued the Coroner deliberately, \'93that you were\
sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the\
boudoir. That is so, is it not?\'94\
\
This was news to me and glancing sideways at Poirot, I fancied that it\
was news to him as well.\
\
There was the faintest pause, the mere hesitation of a moment, before\
she answered:\
\
\'93Yes, that is so.\'94\
\
\'93And the boudoir window was open, was it not?\'94\
\
Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered:\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside, especially as\
they were raised in anger. In fact, they would be more audible where\
you were than in the hall.\'94\
\
\'93Possibly.\'94\
\
\'93Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel?\'94\
\
\'93I really do not remember hearing anything.\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean to say you did not hear voices?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, I heard the voices, but I did not hear what they said.\'94 A\
faint spot of colour came into her cheek. \'93I am not in the habit of\
listening to private conversations.\'94\
\
The Coroner persisted.\
\
\'93And you remember nothing at all? _Nothing_, Mrs. Cavendish? Not one\
stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _was_ a private\
conversation?\'94\
\
She paused, and seemed to reflect, still outwardly as calm as ever.\
\
\'93Yes; I remember. Mrs. Inglethorp said something\'97I do not remember\
exactly what\'97about causing scandal between husband and wife.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 the Coroner leant back satisfied. \'93That corresponds with what\
Dorcas heard. But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it\
was a private conversation, you did not move away? You remained where\
you were?\'94\
\
I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them. I\
felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the\
little lawyer, with his insinuations, into pieces, but she replied\
quietly enough:\
\
\'93No. I was very comfortable where I was. I fixed my mind on my book.\'94\
\
\'93And that is all you can tell us?\'94\
\
\'93That is all.\'94\
\
The examination was over, though I doubted if the Coroner was entirely\
satisfied with it. I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell\
more if she chose.\
\
Amy Hill, shop assistant, was next called, and deposed to having sold a\
will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl, under-gardener\
at Styles.\
\
William Earl and Manning succeeded her, and testified to witnessing a\
document. Manning fixed the time at about four-thirty, William was of\
the opinion that it was rather earlier.\
\
Cynthia Murdoch came next. She had, however, little to tell. She had\
known nothing of the tragedy, until awakened by Mrs. Cavendish.\
\
\'93You did not hear the table fall?\'94\
\
\'93No. I was fast asleep.\'94\
\
The Coroner smiled.\
\
\'93A good conscience makes a sound sleeper,\'94 he observed. \'93Thank you,\
Miss Murdoch, that is all.\'94\
\
\'93Miss Howard.\'94\
\
Miss Howard produced the letter written to her by Mrs. Inglethorp on\
the evening of the 17th. Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.\
It added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy. The following is a\
facsimile:\
\
STYLES COURT\
ESSEX\
hand written note:\
\
     July 17th\
     My dear Evelyn\
     Can we not bury\
     the hachet? I have\
     found it hard to forgive\
     the things you said\
     against my dear husband\
     but I am an old woman\
     & very fond of you\
     Yours affectionately,\
    Emily Inglethorpe\
\
\
It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively.\
\
\'93I fear it does not help us much,\'94 said the Coroner, with a sigh.\
\'93There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon.\'94\
\
\'93Plain as a pikestaff to me,\'94 said Miss Howard shortly. \'93It shows\
clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she\'92d been\
made a fool of!\'94\
\
\'93It says nothing of the kind in the letter,\'94 the Coroner pointed out.\
\
\'93No, because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong. But\
_I_ know her. She wanted me back. But she wasn\'92t going to own that I\'92d\
been right. She went round about. Most people do. Don\'92t believe in it\
myself.\'94\
\
Mr. Wells smiled faintly. So, I noticed, did several of the jury. Miss\
Howard was obviously quite a public character.\
\
\'93Anyway, all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time,\'94 continued the\
lady, glancing up and down the jury disparagingly. \'93Talk\'97talk\'97talk!\
When all the time we know perfectly well\'97\'97\'94\
\
The Coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension:\
\
\'93Thank you, Miss Howard, that is all.\'94\
\
I fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied.\
\
Then came the sensation of the day. The Coroner called Albert Mace,\
chemist\'92s assistant.\
\
It was our agitated young man of the pale face. In answer to the\
Coroner\'92s questions, he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist,\
but had only recently come to this particular shop, as the assistant\
formerly there had just been called up for the army.\
\
These preliminaries completed, the Coroner proceeded to business.\
\
\'93Mr. Mace, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
\'93When was this?\'94\
\
\'93Last Monday night.\'94\
\
\'93Monday? Not Tuesday?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir, Monday, the 16th.\'94\
\
\'93Will you tell us to whom you sold it?\'94\
\
You could have heard a pin drop.\
\
\'93Yes, sir. It was to Mr. Inglethorp.\'94\
\
Every eye turned simultaneously to where Alfred Inglethorp was sitting,\
impassive and wooden. He started slightly, as the damning words fell\
from the young man\'92s lips. I half thought he was going to rise from his\
chair, but he remained seated, although a remarkably well acted\
expression of astonishment rose on his face.\
\
\'93You are sure of what you say?\'94 asked the Coroner sternly.\
\
\'93Quite sure, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the\
counter?\'94\
\
The wretched young man wilted visibly under the Coroner\'92s frown.\
\
\'93Oh, no, sir\'97of course not. But, seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the\
Hall, I thought there was no harm in it. He said it was to poison a\
dog.\'94\
\
Inwardly I sympathized. It was only human nature to endeavour to please\
\'93The Hall\'94\'97especially when it might result in custom being transferred\
from Coot\'92s to the local establishment.\
\
\'93Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, Mr. Inglethorp did so.\'94\
\
\'93Have you got the book here?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir.\'94\
\
It was produced; and, with a few words of stern censure, the Coroner\
dismissed the wretched Mr. Mace.\
\
Then, amidst a breathless silence, Alfred Inglethorp was called. Did he\
realize, I wondered, how closely the halter was being drawn around his\
neck?\
\
The Coroner went straight to the point.\
\
\'93On Monday evening last, did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of\
poisoning a dog?\'94\
\
Inglethorp replied with perfect calmness:\
\
\'93No, I did not. There is no dog at Styles, except an outdoor sheepdog,\
which is in perfect health.\'94\
\
\'93You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on\
Monday last?\'94\
\
\'93I do.\'94\
\
\'93Do you also deny _this_?\'94\
\
The Coroner handed him the register in which his signature was\
inscribed.\
\
\'93Certainly I do. The hand-writing is quite different from mine. I will\
show you.\'94\
\
He took an old envelope out of his pocket, and wrote his name on it,\
handing it to the jury. It was certainly utterly dissimilar.\
\
\'93Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace\'92s statement?\'94\
\
Alfred Inglethorp replied imperturbably:\
\
\'93Mr. Mace must have been mistaken.\'94\
\
The Coroner hesitated for a moment, and then said:\
\
\'93Mr. Inglethorp, as a mere matter of form, would you mind telling us\
where you were on the evening of Monday, July 16th?\'94\
\
\'93Really\'97I cannot remember.\'94\
\
\'93That is absurd, Mr. Inglethorp,\'94 said the Coroner sharply. \'93Think\
again.\'94\
\
Inglethorp shook his head.\
\
\'93I cannot tell you. I have an idea that I was out walking.\'94\
\
\'93In what direction?\'94\
\
\'93I really can\'92t remember.\'94\
\
The Coroner\'92s face grew graver.\
\
\'93Were you in company with anyone?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Did you meet anyone on your walk?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93That is a pity,\'94 said the Coroner dryly. \'93I am to take it then that\
you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively\
recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine?\'94\
\
\'93If you like to take it that way, yes.\'94\
\
\'93Be careful, Mr. Inglethorp.\'94\
\
Poirot was fidgeting nervously.\
\
\'93_Sacr\'e9!_\'94 he murmured. \'93Does this imbecile of a man _want_ to be\
arrested?\'94\
\
Inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression. His futile denials\
would not have convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly\
to the next point, and Poirot drew a deep breath of relief.\
\
\'93You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon?\'94\
\
\'93Pardon me,\'94 interrupted Alfred Inglethorp, \'93you have been misinformed.\
I had no quarrel with my dear wife. The whole story is absolutely\
untrue. I was absent from the house the entire afternoon.\'94\
\
\'93Have you anyone who can testify to that?\'94\
\
\'93You have my word,\'94 said Inglethorp haughtily.\
\
The Coroner did not trouble to reply.\
\
\'93There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your\
disagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93Those witnesses were mistaken.\'94\
\
I was puzzled. The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was\
staggered. I looked at Poirot. There was an expression of exultation on\
his face which I could not understand. Was he at last convinced of\
Alfred Inglethorp\'92s guilt?\
\
\'93Mr. Inglethorp,\'94 said the Coroner, \'93you have heard your wife\'92s dying\
words repeated here. Can you explain them in any way?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly I can.\'94\
\
\'93You can?\'94\
\
\'93It seems to me very simple. The room was dimly lighted. Dr. Bauerstein\
is much of my height and build, and, like me, wears a beard. In the dim\
light, and suffering as she was, my poor wife mistook him for me.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 murmured Poirot to himself. \'93But it is an idea, that!\'94\
\
\'93You think it is true?\'94 I whispered.\
\
\'93I do not say that. But it is truly an ingenious supposition.\'94\
\
\'93You read my wife\'92s last words as an accusation\'94\'97Inglethorp was\
continuing\'97\'93they were, on the contrary, an appeal to me.\'94\
\
The Coroner reflected a moment, then he said:\
\
\'93I believe, Mr. Inglethorp, that you yourself poured out the coffee,\
and took it to your wife that evening?\'94\
\
\'93I poured it out, yes. But I did not take it to her. I meant to do so,\
but I was told that a friend was at the hall door, so I laid down the\
coffee on the hall table. When I came through the hall again a few\
minutes later, it was gone.\'94\
\
This statement might, or might not, be true, but it did not seem to me\
to improve matters much for Inglethorp. In any case, he had had ample\
time to introduce the poison.\
\
At that point, Poirot nudged me gently, indicating two men who were\
sitting together near the door. One was a little, sharp, dark,\
ferret-faced man, the other was tall and fair.\
\
I questioned Poirot mutely. He put his lips to my ear.\
\
\'93Do you know who that little man is?\'94\
\
I shook my head.\
\
\'93That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard\'97Jimmy Japp.\
The other man is from Scotland Yard too. Things are moving quickly, my\
friend.\'94\
\
I stared at the two men intently. There was certainly nothing of the\
policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being\
official personages.\
\
I was still staring, when I was startled and recalled by the verdict\
being given:\
\
\'93Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown.\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VII. POIROT PAYS HIS DEBTS\
\
As we came out of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle\
pressure of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the\
Scotland Yard men.\
\
In a few moments, they emerged, and Poirot at once stepped forward, and\
accosted the shorter of the two.\
\
\'93I fear you do not remember me, Inspector Japp.\'94\
\
\'93Why, if it isn\'92t Mr. Poirot!\'94 cried the Inspector. He turned to the\
other man. \'93You\'92ve heard me speak of Mr. Poirot? It was in 1904 he and\
I worked together\'97the Abercrombie forgery case\'97you remember, he was run\
down in Brussels. Ah, those were great days, moosier. Then, do you\
remember \'91Baron\'92 Altara? There was a pretty rogue for you! He eluded\
the clutches of half the police in Europe. But we nailed him in\
Antwerp\'97thanks to Mr. Poirot here.\'94\
\
As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer,\
and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn,\
introduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.\
\
\'93I need hardly ask what you are doing here, gentlemen,\'94 remarked\
Poirot.\
\
Japp closed one eye knowingly.\
\
\'93No, indeed. Pretty clear case I should say.\'94\
\
But Poirot answered gravely:\
\
\'93There I differ from you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, come!\'94 said Summerhaye, opening his lips for the first time.\
\'93Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight. The man\'92s caught\
red-handed. How he could be such a fool beats me!\'94\
\
But Japp was looking attentively at Poirot.\
\
\'93Hold your fire, Summerhaye,\'94 he remarked jocularly. \'93Me and Moosier\
here have met before\'97and there\'92s no man\'92s judgment I\'92d sooner take than\
his. If I\'92m not greatly mistaken, he\'92s got something up his sleeve.\
Isn\'92t that so, moosier?\'94\
\
Poirot smiled.\
\
\'93I have drawn certain conclusions\'97yes.\'94\
\
Summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his\
scrutiny of Poirot.\
\
\'93It\'92s this way,\'94 he said, \'93so far, we\'92ve only seen the case from the\
outside. That\'92s where the Yard\'92s at a disadvantage in a case of this\
kind, where the murder\'92s only out, so to speak, after the inquest. A\
lot depends on being on the spot first thing, and that\'92s where Mr.\
Poirot\'92s had the start of us. We shouldn\'92t have been here as soon as\
this even, if it hadn\'92t been for the fact that there was a smart doctor\
on the spot, who gave us the tip through the Coroner. But you\'92ve been\
on the spot from the first, and you may have picked up some little\
hints. From the evidence at the inquest, Mr. Inglethorp murdered his\
wife as sure as I stand here, and if anyone but you hinted the contrary\
I\'92d laugh in his face. I must say I was surprised the jury didn\'92t bring\
it in Wilful Murder against him right off. I think they would have, if\
it hadn\'92t been for the Coroner\'97he seemed to be holding them back.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps, though, you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket\
now,\'94 suggested Poirot.\
\
A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from Japp\'92s\
expressive countenance.\
\
\'93Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven\'92t,\'94 he remarked dryly.\
\
Poirot looked at him thoughtfully.\
\
\'93I am very anxious, Messieurs, that he should not be arrested.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say,\'94 observed Summerhaye sarcastically.\
\
Japp was regarding Poirot with comical perplexity.\
\
\'93Can\'92t you go a little further, Mr. Poirot? A wink\'92s as good as a\
nod\'97from you. You\'92ve been on the spot\'97and the Yard doesn\'92t want to make\
any mistakes, you know.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded gravely.\
\
\'93That is exactly what I thought. Well, I will tell you this. Use your\
warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos\'97the case\
against him will be dismissed at once! _Comme \'e7a!_\'94 And he snapped his\
fingers expressively.\
\
Japp\'92s face grew grave, though Summerhaye gave an incredulous snort.\
\
As for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment. I could only\
conclude that Poirot was mad.\
\
Japp had taken out a handkerchief, and was gently dabbing his brow.\
\
\'93I daren\'92t do it, Mr. Poirot. _I_\'92d take your word, but there\'92s others\
over me who\'92ll be asking what the devil I mean by it. Can\'92t you give me\
a little more to go on?\'94\
\
Poirot reflected a moment.\
\
\'93It can be done,\'94 he said at last. \'93I admit I do not wish it. It forces\
my hand. I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the\
present, but what you say is very just\'97the word of a Belgian policeman,\
whose day is past, is not enough! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be\
arrested. That I have sworn, as my friend Hastings here knows. See,\
then, my good Japp, you go at once to Styles?\'94\
\
\'93Well, in about half an hour. We\'92re seeing the Coroner and the doctor\
first.\'94\
\
\'93Good. Call for me in passing\'97the last house in the village. I will go\
with you. At Styles, Mr. Inglethorp will give you, or if he refuses\'97as\
is probable\'97I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the\
case against him could not possibly be sustained. Is that a bargain?\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s a bargain,\'94 said Japp heartily. \'93And, on behalf of the Yard,\
I\'92m much obliged to you, though I\'92m bound to confess I can\'92t at present\
see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence, but you always\
were a marvel! So long, then, moosier.\'94\
\
The two detectives strode away, Summerhaye with an incredulous grin on\
his face.\
\
\'93Well, my friend,\'94 cried Poirot, before I could get in a word, \'93what do\
you think? _Mon Dieu!_ I had some warm moments in that court; I did not\
figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to\
say anything at all. Decidedly, it was the policy of an imbecile.\'94\
\
\'93H\'92m! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility,\'94 I\
remarked. \'93For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend\
himself except by silence?\'94\
\
\'93Why, in a thousand ingenious ways,\'94 cried Poirot. \'93See; say that it is\
I who have committed this murder, I can think of seven most plausible\
stories! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp\'92s stony denials!\'94\
\
I could not help laughing.\
\
\'93My dear Poirot, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy! But,\
seriously, in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives, you\
surely cannot still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp\'92s\
innocence?\'94\
\
\'93Why not now as much as before? Nothing has changed.\'94\
\
\'93But the evidence is so conclusive.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, too conclusive.\'94\
\
We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now\
familiar stairs.\
\
\'93Yes, yes, too conclusive,\'94 continued Poirot, almost to himself. \'93Real\
evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory. It has to be\
examined\'97sifted. But here the whole thing is cut and dried. No, my\
friend, this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured\'97so cleverly\
that it has defeated its own ends.\'94\
\
\'93How do you make that out?\'94\
\
\'93Because, so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible,\
it was very hard to disprove. But, in his anxiety, the criminal has\
drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free.\'94\
\
I was silent. And in a minute or two, Poirot continued:\
\
\'93Let us look at the matter like this. Here is a man, let us say, who\
sets out to poison his wife. He has lived by his wits as the saying\
goes. Presumably, therefore, he has some wits. He is not altogether a\
fool. Well, how does he set about it? He goes boldly to the village\
chemist\'92s and purchases strychnine under his own name, with a trumped\
up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd. He does not\
employ the poison that night. No, he waits until he has had a violent\
quarrel with her, of which the whole household is cognisant, and which\
naturally directs their suspicions upon him. He prepares no defence\'97no\
shadow of an alibi, yet he knows the chemist\'92s assistant must\
necessarily come forward with the facts. Bah! Do not ask me to believe\
that any man could be so idiotic! Only a lunatic, who wished to commit\
suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!\'94\
\
\'93Still\'97I do not see\'97\'97\'94 I began.\
\
\'93Neither do I see. I tell you, _mon ami_, it puzzles me. _Me_\'97Hercule\
Poirot!\'94\
\
\'93But if you believe him innocent, how do you explain his buying the\
strychnine?\'94\
\
\'93Very simply. He did _not_ buy it.\'94\
\
\'93But Mace recognized him!\'94\
\
\'93I beg your pardon, he saw a man with a black beard like Mr.\
Inglethorp\'92s, and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp, and dressed in\
Mr. Inglethorp\'92s rather noticeable clothes. He could not recognize a\
man whom he had probably only seen in the distance, since, you\
remember, he himself had only been in the village a fortnight, and Mrs.\
Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot\'92s in Tadminster.\'94\
\
\'93Then you think\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93_Mon ami_, do you remember the two points I laid stress upon? Leave\
the first one for the moment, what was the second?\'94\
\
\'93The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes, has\
a black beard, and uses glasses,\'94 I quoted.\
\
\'93Exactly. Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or\
Lawrence Cavendish. Would it be easy?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I said thoughtfully. \'93Of course an actor\'97\'97\'94\
\
But Poirot cut me short ruthlessly.\
\
\'93And why would it not be easy? I will tell you, my friend: Because they\
are both clean-shaven men. To make up successfully as one of these two\
in broad daylight, it would need an actor of genius, and a certain\
initial facial resemblance. But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp, all\
that is changed. His clothes, his beard, the glasses which hide his\
eyes\'97those are the salient points about his personal appearance. Now,\
what is the first instinct of the criminal? To divert suspicion from\
himself, is it not so? And how can he best do that? By throwing it on\
someone else. In this instance, there was a man ready to his hand.\
Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp\'92s guilt. It was\
a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected; but, to make it a\
sure thing there must be tangible proof\'97such as the actual buying of\
the poison, and that, with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr.\
Inglethorp, was not difficult. Remember, this young Mace had never\
actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp. How should he doubt that the man in\
his clothes, with his beard and his glasses, was not Alfred\
Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93It may be so,\'94 I said, fascinated by Poirot\'92s eloquence. \'93But, if that\
was the case, why does he not say where he was at six o\'92clock on Monday\
evening?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, why indeed?\'94 said Poirot, calming down. \'93If he were arrested, he\
probably would speak, but I do not want it to come to that. I must make\
him see the gravity of his position. There is, of course, something\
discreditable behind his silence. If he did not murder his wife, he is,\
nevertheless, a scoundrel, and has something of his own to conceal,\
quite apart from the murder.\'94\
\
\'93What can it be?\'94 I mused, won over to Poirot\'92s views for the moment,\
although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction\
was the correct one.\
\
\'93Can you not guess?\'94 asked Poirot, smiling.\
\
\'93No, can you?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, I had a little idea sometime ago\'97and it has turned out to be\
correct.\'94\
\
\'93You never told me,\'94 I said reproachfully.\
\
Poirot spread out his hands apologetically.\
\
\'93Pardon me, _mon ami_, you were not precisely _sympathique_.\'94 He turned\
to me earnestly. \'93Tell me\'97you see now that he must not be arrested?\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps,\'94 I said doubtfully, for I was really quite indifferent to the\
fate of Alfred Inglethorp, and thought that a good fright would do him\
no harm.\
\
Poirot, who was watching me intently, gave a sigh.\
\
\'93Come, my friend,\'94 he said, changing the subject, \'93apart from Mr.\
Inglethorp, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, pretty much what I expected.\'94\
\
\'93Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it?\'94\
\
My thoughts flew to Mary Cavendish, and I hedged:\
\
\'93In what way?\'94\
\
\'93Well, Mr. Lawrence Cavendish\'92s evidence for instance?\'94\
\
I was relieved.\
\
\'93Oh, Lawrence! No, I don\'92t think so. He\'92s always a nervous chap.\'94\
\
\'93His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally\
by means of the tonic she was taking, that did not strike you as\
strange\'97 _hein?_\'94\
\
\'93No, I can\'92t say it did. The doctors ridiculed it of course. But it was\
quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make.\'94\
\
\'93But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman. You told me yourself that he\
had started by studying medicine, and that he had taken his degree.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that\'92s true. I never thought of that.\'94 I was rather startled. \'93It\
_is_ odd.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded.\
\
\'93From the first, his behaviour has been peculiar. Of all the household,\
he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine\
poisoning, and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold\
strenuously the theory of death from natural causes. If it had been\
Monsieur John, I could have understood it. He has no technical\
knowledge, and is by nature unimaginative. But Monsieur Lawrence\'97no!\
And now, to-day, he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have\
known was ridiculous. There is food for thought in this, _mon ami!_\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s very confusing,\'94 I agreed.\
\
\'93Then there is Mrs. Cavendish,\'94 continued Poirot. \'93That\'92s another who\
is not telling all she knows! What do you make of her attitude?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know what to make of it. It seems inconceivable that she\
should be shielding Alfred Inglethorp. Yet that is what it looks like.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded reflectively.\
\
\'93Yes, it is queer. One thing is certain, she overheard a good deal more\
of that \'91private conversation\'92 than she was willing to admit.\'94\
\
\'93And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to\
eavesdrop!\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. One thing her evidence _has_ shown me. I made a mistake.\
Dorcas was quite right. The quarrel did take place earlier in the\
afternoon, about four o\'92clock, as she said.\'94\
\
I looked at him curiously. I had never understood his insistence on\
that point.\
\
\'93Yes, a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day,\'94 continued Poirot.\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein, now, what was _he_ doing up and dressed at that hour\
in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the\
fact.\'94\
\
\'93He has insomnia, I believe,\'94 I said doubtfully.\
\
\'93Which is a very good, or a very bad explanation,\'94 remarked Poirot. \'93It\
covers everything, and explains nothing. I shall keep my eye on our\
clever Dr. Bauerstein.\'94\
\
\'93Any more faults to find with the evidence?\'94 I inquired satirically.\
\
\'93_Mon ami_,\'94 replied Poirot gravely, \'93when you find that people are not\
telling you the truth\'97look out! Now, unless I am much mistaken, at the\
inquest to-day only one\'97at most, two persons were speaking the truth\
without reservation or subterfuge.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, come now, Poirot! I won\'92t cite Lawrence, or Mrs. Cavendish. But\
there\'92s John\'97and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?\'94\
\
\'93Both of them, my friend? One, I grant you, but both\'97\'97!\'94\
\
His words gave me an unpleasant shock. Miss Howard\'92s evidence,\
unimportant as it was, had been given in such a downright\
straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her\
sincerity. Still, I had a great respect for Poirot\'92s sagacity\'97except on\
the occasions when he was what I described to myself as \'93foolishly\
pig-headed.\'94\
\
\'93Do you really think so?\'94 I asked. \'93Miss Howard had always seemed to me\
so essentially honest\'97almost uncomfortably so.\'94\
\
Poirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom. He\
seemed to speak, and then checked himself.\
\
\'93Miss Murdoch too,\'94 I continued, \'93there\'92s nothing untruthful about\
_her_.\'94\
\
\'93No. But it was strange that she never heard a sound, sleeping next\
door; whereas Mrs. Cavendish, in the other wing of the building,\
distinctly heard the table fall.\'94\
\
\'93Well, she\'92s young. And she sleeps soundly.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, yes, indeed! She must be a famous sleeper, that one!\'94\
\
I did not quite like the tone of his voice, but at that moment a smart\
knock reached our ears, and looking out of the window we perceived the\
two detectives waiting for us below.\
\
Poirot seized his hat, gave a ferocious twist to his moustache, and,\
carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve, motioned\
me to precede him down the stairs; there we joined the detectives and\
set out for Styles.\
\
I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a\
shock\'97especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had\
realized that it was only a matter of time. Still, the presence of the\
detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could\
have done.\
\
Poirot had conferred with Japp in a low tone on the way up, and it was\
the latter functionary who requested that the household, with the\
exception of the servants, should be assembled together in the\
drawing-room. I realized the significance of this. It was up to Poirot\
to make his boast good.\
\
Personally, I was not sanguine. Poirot might have excellent reasons for\
his belief in Inglethorp\'92s innocence, but a man of the type of\
Summerhaye would require tangible proofs, and these I doubted if Poirot\
could supply.\
\
Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room, the door of\
which Japp closed. Poirot politely set chairs for everyone. The\
Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes. I think that for the\
first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream, but a\
tangible reality. We had read of such things\'97now we ourselves were\
actors in the drama. To-morrow the daily papers, all over England,\
would blazon out the news in staring headlines:\
\
\'93MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX\'94\
\
    \'93WEALTHY LADY POISONED\'94\
\
\
There would be pictures of Styles, snap-shots of \'93The family leaving\
the Inquest\'94\'97the village photographer had not been idle! All the things\
that one had read a hundred times\'97things that happen to other people,\
not to oneself. And now, in this house, a murder had been committed. In\
front of us were \'93the detectives in charge of the case.\'94 The well-known\
glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before\
Poirot opened the proceedings.\
\
I think everyone was a little surprised that it should be he and not\
one of the official detectives who took the initiative.\
\
\'93_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_,\'94 said Poirot, bowing as though he were a\
celebrity about to deliver a lecture, \'93I have asked you to come here\
all together, for a certain object. That object, it concerns Mr. Alfred\
Inglethorp.\'94\
\
Inglethorp was sitting a little by himself\'97I think, unconsciously,\
everyone had drawn his chair slightly away from him\'97and he gave a faint\
start as Poirot pronounced his name.\
\
\'93Mr. Inglethorp,\'94 said Poirot, addressing him directly, \'93a very dark\
shadow is resting on this house\'97the shadow of murder.\'94\
\
Inglethorp shook his head sadly.\
\
\'93My poor wife,\'94 he murmured. \'93Poor Emily! It is terrible.\'94\
\
\'93I do not think, monsieur,\'94 said Poirot pointedly, \'93that you quite\
realize how terrible it may be\'97for you.\'94 And as Inglethorp did not\
appear to understand, he added: \'93Mr. Inglethorp, you are standing in\
very grave danger.\'94\
\
The two detectives fidgeted. I saw the official caution \'93Anything you\
say will be used in evidence against you,\'94 actually hovering on\
Summerhaye\'92s lips. Poirot went on.\
\
\'93Do you understand now, monsieur?\'94\
\
\'93No. What do you mean?\'94\
\
\'93I mean,\'94 said Poirot deliberately, \'93that you are suspected of\
poisoning your wife.\'94\
\
A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking.\
\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 cried Inglethorp, starting up. \'93What a monstrous idea!\
_I_\'97poison my dearest Emily!\'94\
\
\'93I do not think\'94\'97Poirot watched him narrowly\'97\'93that you quite realize\
the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest. Mr.\
Inglethorp, knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to\
say where you were at six o\'92clock on Monday afternoon?\'94\
\
With a groan, Alfred Inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in\
his hands. Poirot approached and stood over him.\
\
\'93Speak!\'94 he cried menacingly.\
\
With an effort, Inglethorp raised his face from his hands. Then, slowly\
and deliberately, he shook his head.\
\
\'93You will not speak?\'94\
\
\'93No. I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me\
of what you say.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.\
\
\'93_Soit!_\'94 he said. \'93Then I must speak for you.\'94\
\
Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\
\
\'93You? How can you speak? You do not know\'97\'97\'94 he broke off abruptly.\
\
Poirot turned to face us. \'93_Mesdames_ and _messieurs_! I speak! Listen!\
I, Hercule Poirot, affirm that the man who entered the chemist\'92s shop,\
and purchased strychnine at six o\'92clock on Monday last was not Mr.\
Inglethorp, for at six o\'92clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting\
Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm. I can produce no\
less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together, either\
at six or just after and, as you may know, the Abbey Farm, Mrs.\
Raikes\'92s home, is at least two and a half miles distant from the\
village. There is absolutely no question as to the alibi!\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VIII. FRESH SUSPICIONS\
\
There was a moment\'92s stupefied silence. Japp, who was the least\
surprised of any of us, was the first to speak.\
\
\'93My word,\'94 he cried, \'93you\'92re the goods! And no mistake, Mr. Poirot!\
These witnesses of yours are all right, I suppose?\'94\
\
\'93_Voil\'e0!_ I have prepared a list of them\'97names and addresses. You must\
see them, of course. But you will find it all right.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92m sure of that.\'94 Japp lowered his voice. \'93I\'92m much obliged to you. A\
pretty mare\'92s nest arresting him would have been.\'94 He turned to\
Inglethorp. \'93But, if you\'92ll excuse me, sir, why couldn\'92t you say all\
this at the inquest?\'94\
\
\'93I will tell you why,\'94 interrupted Poirot. \'93There was a certain\
rumour\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93A most malicious and utterly untrue one,\'94 interrupted Alfred\
Inglethorp in an agitated voice.\
\
\'93And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at\
present. Am I right?\'94\
\
\'93Quite right.\'94 Inglethorp nodded. \'93With my poor Emily not yet buried,\
can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be\
started.\'94\
\
\'93Between you and me, sir,\'94 remarked Japp, \'93I\'92d sooner have any amount\
of rumours than be arrested for murder. And I venture to think your\
poor lady would have felt the same. And, if it hadn\'92t been for Mr.\
Poirot here, arrested you would have been, as sure as eggs is eggs!\'94\
\
\'93I was foolish, no doubt,\'94 murmured Inglethorp. \'93But you do not know,\
inspector, how I have been persecuted and maligned.\'94 And he shot a\
baleful glance at Evelyn Howard.\
\
\'93Now, sir,\'94 said Japp, turning briskly to John, \'93I should like to see\
the lady\'92s bedroom, please, and after that I\'92ll have a little chat with\
the servants. Don\'92t you bother about anything. Mr. Poirot, here, will\
show me the way.\'94\
\
As they all went out of the room, Poirot turned and made me a sign to\
follow him upstairs. There he caught me by the arm, and drew me aside.\
\
\'93Quick, go to the other wing. Stand there\'97just this side of the baize\
door. Do not move till I come.\'94 Then, turning rapidly, he rejoined the\
two detectives.\
\
I followed his instructions, taking up my position by the baize door,\
and wondering what on earth lay behind the request. Why was I to stand\
in this particular spot on guard? I looked thoughtfully down the\
corridor in front of me. An idea struck me. With the exception of\
Cynthia Murdoch\'92s, everyone\'92s room was in this left wing. Had that\
anything to do with it? Was I to report who came or went? I stood\
faithfully at my post. The minutes passed. Nobody came. Nothing\
happened.\
\
It must have been quite twenty minutes before Poirot rejoined me.\
\
\'93You have not stirred?\'94\
\
\'93No, I\'92ve stuck here like a rock. Nothing\'92s happened.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 Was he pleased, or disappointed? \'93You\'92ve seen nothing at all?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93But you have probably heard something? A big bump\'97eh, _mon ami?_\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Is it possible? Ah, but I am vexed with myself! I am not usually\
clumsy. I made but a slight gesture\'94\'97I know Poirot\'92s gestures\'97\'93with the\
left hand, and over went the table by the bed!\'94\
\
He looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to\
console him.\
\
\'93Never mind, old chap. What does it matter? Your triumph downstairs\
excited you. I can tell you, that was a surprise to us all. There must\
be more in this affair of Inglethorp\'92s with Mrs. Raikes than we\
thought, to make him hold his tongue so persistently. What are you\
going to do now? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows?\'94\
\
\'93Gone down to interview the servants. I showed them all our exhibits. I\
am disappointed in Japp. He has no method!\'94\
\
\'93Hullo!\'94 I said, looking out of the window. \'93Here\'92s Dr. Bauerstein. I\
believe you\'92re right about that man, Poirot. I don\'92t like him.\'94\
\
\'93He is clever,\'94 observed Poirot meditatively.\
\
\'93Oh, clever as the devil! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the\
plight he was in on Tuesday. You never saw such a spectacle!\'94 And I\
described the doctor\'92s adventure. \'93He looked a regular scarecrow!\
Plastered with mud from head to foot.\'94\
\
\'93You saw him, then?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Of course, he didn\'92t want to come in\'97it was just after dinner\'97but\
Mr. Inglethorp insisted.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders. \'93Was Dr.\
Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening? Here? And you never told me? Why\
did you not tell me? Why? Why?\'94\
\
He appeared to be in an absolute frenzy.\
\
\'93My dear Poirot,\'94 I expostulated, \'93I never thought it would interest\
you. I didn\'92t know it was of any importance.\'94\
\
\'93Importance? It is of the first importance! So Dr. Bauerstein was here\
on Tuesday night\'97the night of the murder. Hastings, do you not see?\
That alters everything\'97everything!\'94\
\
I had never seen him so upset. Loosening his hold of me, he\
mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks, still murmuring to\
himself: \'93Yes, that alters everything\'97everything.\'94\
\
Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision.\
\
\'93_Allons!_\'94 he said. \'93We must act at once. Where is Mr. Cavendish?\'94\
\
John was in the smoking-room. Poirot went straight to him.\
\
\'93Mr. Cavendish, I have some important business in Tadminster. A new\
clue. May I take your motor?\'94\
\
\'93Why, of course. Do you mean at once?\'94\
\
\'93If you please.\'94\
\
John rang the bell, and ordered round the car. In another ten minutes,\
we were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster.\
\
\'93Now, Poirot,\'94 I remarked resignedly, \'93perhaps you will tell me what\
all this is about?\'94\
\
\'93Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you\
realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it, the whole position is\
greatly changed. We are face to face with an entirely new problem. We\
know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison. We have\
cleared away the manufactured clues. Now for the real ones. I have\
ascertained that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mrs.\
Cavendish, who was playing tennis with you, could have personated Mr.\
Inglethorp on Monday evening. In the same way, we have his statement\
that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one took much notice of\
that at the inquest\'97but now it has a very different significance. We\
must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually,\
or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there. From your\
account, there are only two people whom we can positively say did not\
go near the coffee\'97Mrs. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that is so.\'94 I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart.\
Mary Cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion.\
\
\'93In clearing Alfred Inglethorp,\'94 continued Poirot, \'93I have been obliged\
to show my hand sooner than I intended. As long as I might be thought\
to be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard. Now, he will\
be doubly careful. Yes\'97doubly careful.\'94 He turned to me abruptly. \'93Tell\
me, Hastings, you yourself\'97have you no suspicions of anybody?\'94\
\
I hesitated. To tell the truth, an idea, wild and extravagant in\
itself, had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain. I had\
rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.\
\
\'93You couldn\'92t call it a suspicion,\'94 I murmured. \'93It\'92s so utterly\
foolish.\'94\
\
\'93Come now,\'94 urged Poirot encouragingly. \'93Do not fear. Speak your mind.\
You should always pay attention to your instincts.\'94\
\
\'93Well then,\'94 I blurted out, \'93it\'92s absurd\'97but I suspect Miss Howard of\
not telling all she knows!\'94\
\
\'93Miss Howard?\'94\
\
\'93Yes\'97you\'92ll laugh at me\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Not at all. Why should I?\'94\
\
\'93I can\'92t help feeling,\'94 I continued blunderingly; \'93that we\'92ve rather\
left her out of the possible suspects, simply on the strength of her\
having been away from the place. But, after all, she was only fifteen\
miles away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively\
that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, my friend,\'94 said Poirot unexpectedly, \'93we can. One of my first\
actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working.\'94\
\
\'93Well?\'94\
\
\'93Well, I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday,\
and that\'97a convoy coming in unexpectedly\'97she had kindly offered to\
remain on night duty, which offer was gratefully accepted. That\
disposes of that.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 I said, rather nonplussed. \'93Really,\'94 I continued, \'93it\'92s her\
extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off\
suspecting her. I can\'92t help feeling she\'92d do anything against him. And\
I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the\
will. She might have burnt the new one, mistaking it for the earlier\
one in his favour. She is so terribly bitter against him.\'94\
\
\'93You consider her vehemence unnatural?\'94\
\
\'93Y\'97es. She is so very violent. I wondered really whether she is quite\
sane on that point.\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head energetically.\
\
\'93No, no, you are on a wrong tack there. There is nothing weak-minded or\
degenerate about Miss Howard. She is an excellent specimen of\
well-balanced English beef and brawn. She is sanity itself.\'94\
\
\'93Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania. My idea was\'97a very\
ridiculous one, no doubt\'97that she had intended to poison him\'97and that,\
in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake. But I don\'92t at\
all see how it could have been done. The whole thing is absurd and\
ridiculous to the last degree.\'94\
\
\'93Still you are right in one thing. It is always wise to suspect\
everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction,\
that they are innocent. Now, what reasons are there against Miss\
Howard\'92s having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93Why, she was devoted to her!\'94 I exclaimed.\
\
\'93Tcha! Tcha!\'94 cried Poirot irritably. \'93You argue like a child. If Miss\
Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady, she would be quite\
equally capable of simulating devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You\
are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against\
Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural; but you are quite wrong\
in the deduction you draw from it. I have drawn my own deductions,\
which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at\
present.\'94 He paused a minute, then went on. \'93Now, to my way of\
thinking, there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard\'92s being the\
murderess.\'94\
\
\'93And that is?\'94\
\
\'93That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s death benefit Miss\
Howard. Now there is no murder without a motive.\'94\
\
I reflected.\
\
\'93Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour?\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head.\
\
\'93But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells?\'94\
\
Poirot smiled.\
\
\'93That was for a reason. I did not want to mention the name of the\
person who was actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the\
same position, so I used her name instead.\'94\
\
\'93Still, Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so. Why, that will, made on the\
afternoon of her death may\'97\'97\'94\
\
But Poirot\'92s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped.\
\
\'93No, my friend. I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.\
But I can tell you this much\'97it was not in Miss Howard\'92s favour.\'94\
\
I accepted his assurance, though I did not really see how he could be\
so positive about the matter.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I said, with a sigh, \'93we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It is\
partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her. It was what you said\
about her evidence at the inquest that set me off.\'94\
\
Poirot looked puzzled.\
\
\'93What did I say about her evidence at the inquest?\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t you remember? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above\
suspicion?\'94\
\
\'93Oh\'97ah\'97yes.\'94 He seemed a little confused, but recovered himself. \'93By\
the way, Hastings, there is something I want you to do for me.\'94\
\
\'93Certainly. What is it?\'94\
\
\'93Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want you\
to say this to him. \'91I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says:\
\'93Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!\'94\'92 Nothing more.\
Nothing less.\'94\
\
\'93\'91Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\'92 Is that\
right?\'94 I asked, much mystified.\
\
\'93Excellent.\'94\
\
\'93But what does it mean?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You have access to the facts.\
Just say that to him, and see what he says.\'94\
\
\'93Very well\'97but it\'92s all extremely mysterious.\'94\
\
We were running into Tadminster now, and Poirot directed the car to the\
\'93Analytical Chemist.\'94\
\
Poirot hopped down briskly, and went inside. In a few minutes he was\
back again.\
\
\'93There,\'94 he said. \'93That is all my business.\'94\
\
\'93What were you doing there?\'94 I asked, in lively curiosity.\
\
\'93I left something to be analysed.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but what?\'94\
\
\'93The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom.\'94\
\
\'93But that has already been tested!\'94 I cried, stupefied. \'93Dr. Bauerstein\
had it tested, and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there\
being strychnine in it.\'94\
\
\'93I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested,\'94 replied Poirot quietly.\
\
\'93Well, then?\'94\
\
\'93Well, I have a fancy for having it analysed again, that is all.\'94\
\
And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him.\
\
This proceeding of Poirot\'92s, in respect of the cocoa, puzzled me\
intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my\
confidence in him, which at one time had rather waned, was fully\
restored since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp\'92s innocence had been so\
triumphantly vindicated.\
\
The funeral of Mrs. Inglethorp took place the following day, and on\
Monday, as I came down to a late breakfast, John drew me aside, and\
informed me that Mr. Inglethorp was leaving that morning, to take up\
his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his\
plans.\
\
\'93And really it\'92s a great relief to think he\'92s going, Hastings,\'94\
continued my honest friend. \'93It was bad enough before, when we thought\
he\'92d done it, but I\'92m hanged if it isn\'92t worse now, when we all feel\
guilty for having been so down on the fellow. The fact is, we\'92ve\
treated him abominably. Of course, things did look black against him. I\
don\'92t see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we\
did. Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there\'92s a\
beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when\
one doesn\'92t like the fellow a bit better than one did before. The whole\
thing\'92s damned awkward! And I\'92m thankful he\'92s had the tact to take\
himself off. It\'92s a good thing Styles wasn\'92t the mater\'92s to leave to\
him. Couldn\'92t bear to think of the fellow lording it here. He\'92s welcome\
to her money.\'94\
\
\'93You\'92ll be able to keep up the place all right?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Oh, yes. There are the death duties, of course, but half my father\'92s\
money goes with the place, and Lawrence will stay with us for the\
present, so there is his share as well. We shall be pinched at first,\
of course, because, as I once told you, I am in a bit of a hole\
financially myself. Still, the Johnnies will wait now.\'94\
\
In the general relief at Inglethorp\'92s approaching departure, we had the\
most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy. Cynthia,\
whose young spirits were naturally buoyant, was looking quite her\
pretty self again, and we all, with the exception of Lawrence, who\
seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous, were quietly cheerful, at the\
opening of a new and hopeful future.\
\
The papers, of course, had been full of the tragedy. Glaring headlines,\
sandwiched biographies of every member of the household, subtle\
innuendoes, the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue.\
Nothing was spared us. It was a slack time. The war was momentarily\
inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in\
fashionable life: \'93The Mysterious Affair at Styles\'94 was the topic of\
the moment.\
\
Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes. The house was\
constantly besieged by reporters, who were consistently denied\
admission, but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds,\
where they lay in wait with cameras, for any unwary members of the\
household. We all lived in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men\
came and went, examining, questioning, lynx-eyed and reserved of\
tongue. Towards what end they were working, we did not know. Had they\
any clue, or would the whole thing remain in the category of\
undiscovered crimes?\
\
After breakfast, Dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously, and asked if\
she might have a few words with me.\
\
\'93Certainly. What is it, Dorcas?\'94\
\
\'93Well, it\'92s just this, sir. You\'92ll be seeing the Belgian gentleman\
to-day perhaps?\'94 I nodded. \'93Well, sir, you know how he asked me so\
particular if the mistress, or anyone else, had a green dress?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, yes. You have found one?\'94 My interest was aroused.\
\
\'93No, not that, sir. But since then I\'92ve remembered what the young\
gentlemen\'94\'97John and Lawrence were still the \'93young gentlemen\'94 to\
Dorcas\'97\'93call the \'91dressing-up box.\'92 It\'92s up in the front attic, sir. A\
great chest, full of old clothes and fancy dresses, and what not. And\
it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst\
them. So, if you\'92d tell the Belgian gentleman\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93I will tell him, Dorcas,\'94 I promised.\
\
\'93Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he is, sir. And quite\
a different class from them two detectives from London, what goes\
prying about, and asking questions. I don\'92t hold with foreigners as a\
rule, but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave\
Belges isn\'92t the ordinary run of foreigners, and certainly he\'92s a most\
polite spoken gentleman.\'94\
\
Dear old Dorcas! As she stood there, with her honest face upturned to\
mine, I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned\
servant that is so fast dying out.\
\
I thought I might as well go down to the village at once, and look up\
Poirot; but I met him half-way, coming up to the house, and at once\
gave him Dorcas\'92s message.\
\
\'93Ah, the brave Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although\'97but no\
matter\'97we will examine it all the same.\'94\
\
We entered the house by one of the windows. There was no one in the\
hall, and we went straight up to the attic.\
\
Sure enough, there was the chest, a fine old piece, all studded with\
brass nails, and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of\
garment.\
\
Poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony. There\
were one or two green fabrics of varying shades; but Poirot shook his\
head over them all. He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search, as\
though he expected no great results from it. Suddenly he gave an\
exclamation.\
\
\'93What is it?\'94\
\
\'93Look!\'94\
\
The chest was nearly empty, and there, reposing right at the bottom,\
was a magnificent black beard.\
\
\'93_Oh\'f3!_\'94 said Poirot. \'93_Oh\'f3!_\'94 He turned it over in his hands,\
examining it closely. \'93New,\'94 he remarked. \'93Yes, quite new.\'94\
\
After a moment\'92s hesitation, he replaced it in the chest, heaped all\
the other things on top of it as before, and made his way briskly\
downstairs. He went straight to the pantry, where we found Dorcas\
busily polishing her silver.\
\
Poirot wished her good morning with Gallic politeness, and went on:\
\
\'93We have been looking through that chest, Dorcas. I am much obliged to\
you for mentioning it. There is, indeed, a fine collection there. Are\
they often used, may I ask?\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to time we do\
have what the young gentlemen call \'91a dress-up night.\'92 And very funny\
it is sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he\'92s wonderful. Most comic! I shall\
never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he\
called it\'97a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in\
his hand, and \'91Mind, Dorcas,\'92 he says, \'91you\'92ll have to be very\
respectful. This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it\'92s off with\
your head if I\'92m at all displeased with you!\'92 Miss Cynthia, she was\
what they call an Apache, or some such name\'97a Frenchified sort of\
cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You\'92d never have\
believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into\
such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her.\'94\
\
\'93These evenings must have been great fun,\'94 said Poirot genially. \'93I\
suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs,\
when he was Shah of Persia?\'94\
\
\'93He did have a beard, sir,\'94 replied Dorcas, smiling. \'93And well I know\
it, for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with! And\
I\'92m sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn\'92t know as\
there was a beard up there at all. It must have been got quite lately,\
I think. There was a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of\
hair. Burnt corks they use mostly\'97though \'91tis messy getting it off\
again. Miss Cynthia was a nigger once, and, oh, the trouble she had.\'94\
\
\'93So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard,\'94 said Poirot\
thoughtfully, as we walked out into the hall again.\
\
\'93Do you think it is _the_ one?\'94 I whispered eagerly.\
\
Poirot nodded.\
\
\'93I do. You notice it had been trimmed?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Yes. It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp\'92s, and I found one\
or two snipped hairs. Hastings, this affair is very deep.\'94\
\
\'93Who put it in the chest, I wonder?\'94\
\
\'93Someone with a good deal of intelligence,\'94 remarked Poirot dryly. \'93You\
realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its\
presence would not be remarked? Yes, he is intelligent. But we must be\
more intelligent. We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us\
of being intelligent at all.\'94\
\
I acquiesced.\
\
\'93There, _mon ami_, you will be of great assistance to me.\'94\
\
I was pleased with the compliment. There had been times when I hardly\
thought that Poirot appreciated me at my true worth.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he continued, staring at me thoughtfully, \'93you will be\
invaluable.\'94\
\
This was naturally gratifying, but Poirot\'92s next words were not so\
welcome.\
\
\'93I must have an ally in the house,\'94 he observed reflectively.\
\
\'93You have me,\'94 I protested.\
\
\'93True, but you are not sufficient.\'94\
\
I was hurt, and showed it. Poirot hurried to explain himself.\
\
\'93You do not quite take my meaning. You are known to be working with me.\
I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I see. How about John?\'94\
\
\'93No, I think not.\'94\
\
\'93The dear fellow isn\'92t perhaps very bright,\'94 I said thoughtfully.\
\
\'93Here comes Miss Howard,\'94 said Poirot suddenly. \'93She is the very\
person. But I am in her black books, since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp.\
Still, we can but try.\'94\
\
With a nod that was barely civil, Miss Howard assented to Poirot\'92s\
request for a few minutes\'92 conversation.\
\
We went into the little morning-room, and Poirot closed the door.\
\
\'93Well, Monsieur Poirot,\'94 said Miss Howard impatiently, \'93what is it? Out\
with it. I\'92m busy.\'94\
\
\'93Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once asked you to help me?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I do.\'94 The lady nodded. \'93And I told you I\'92d help you with\
pleasure\'97to hang Alfred Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 Poirot studied her seriously. \'93Miss Howard, I will ask you one\
question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully.\'94\
\
\'93Never tell lies,\'94 replied Miss Howard.\
\
\'93It is this. Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by\
her husband?\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94 she asked sharply. \'93You needn\'92t think your pretty\
explanations influence me in the slightest. I\'92ll admit that it wasn\'92t\
he who bought strychnine at the chemist\'92s shop. What of that? I dare\
say he soaked fly paper, as I told you at the beginning.\'94\
\
\'93That is arsenic\'97not strychnine,\'94 said Poirot mildly.\
\
\'93What does that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way\
just as well as strychnine. If I\'92m convinced he did it, it doesn\'92t\
matter a jot to me _how_ he did it.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. _If_ you are convinced he did it,\'94 said Poirot quietly. \'93I\
will put my question in another form. Did you ever in your heart of\
hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband?\'94\
\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 cried Miss Howard. \'93Haven\'92t I always told you the man\
is a villain? Haven\'92t I always told you he would murder her in her bed?\
Haven\'92t I always hated him like poison?\'94\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Poirot. \'93That bears out my little idea entirely.\'94\
\
\'93What little idea?\'94\
\
\'93Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day\
of my friend\'92s arrival here? He repeated it to me, and there is a\
sentence of yours that has impressed me very much. Do you remember\
affirming that if a crime had been committed, and anyone you loved had\
been murdered, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the\
criminal was, even if you were quite unable to prove it?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I remember saying that. I believe it too. I suppose you think it\
nonsense?\'94\
\
\'93Not at all.\'94\
\
\'93And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred\
Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Poirot curtly. \'93Because your instinct is not against Mr.\
Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93No. You wish to believe he committed the crime. You believe him\
capable of committing it. But your instinct tells you he did not commit\
it. It tells you more\'97shall I go on?\'94\
\
She was staring at him, fascinated, and made a slight affirmative\
movement of the hand.\
\
\'93Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp?\
It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe.\
It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct, which\
tells you another name\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93No, no, no!\'94 cried Miss Howard wildly, flinging up her hands. \'93Don\'92t\
say it! Oh, don\'92t say it! It isn\'92t true! It can\'92t be true. I don\'92t know\
what put such a wild\'97such a dreadful\'97idea into my head!\'94\
\
\'93I am right, am I not?\'94 asked Poirot.\
\
\'93Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to have guessed. But it can\'92t be\
so\'97it\'92s too monstrous, too impossible. It _must_ be Alfred Inglethorp.\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head gravely.\
\
\'93Don\'92t ask me about it,\'94 continued Miss Howard, \'93because I shan\'92t tell\
you. I won\'92t admit it, even to myself. I must be mad to think of such a\
thing.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded, as if satisfied.\
\
\'93I will ask you nothing. It is enough for me that it is as I thought.\
And I\'97I, too, have an instinct. We are working together towards a\
common end.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t ask me to help you, because I won\'92t. I wouldn\'92t lift a finger\
to\'97to\'97\'97\'94 She faltered.\
\
\'93You will help me in spite of yourself. I ask you nothing\'97but you will\
be my ally. You will not be able to help yourself. You will do the only\
thing that I want of you.\'94\
\
\'93And that is?\'94\
\
\'93You will watch!\'94\
\
Evelyn Howard bowed her head.\
\
\'93Yes, I can\'92t help doing that. I am always watching\'97always hoping I\
shall be proved wrong.\'94\
\
\'93If we are wrong, well and good,\'94 said Poirot. \'93No one will be more\
pleased than I shall. But, if we are right? If we are right, Miss\
Howard, on whose side are you then?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know, I don\'92t know\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Come now.\'94\
\
\'93It could be hushed up.\'94\
\
\'93There must be no hushing up.\'94\
\
\'93But Emily herself\'97\'97\'94 She broke off.\
\
\'93Miss Howard,\'94 said Poirot gravely, \'93this is unworthy of you.\'94\
\
Suddenly she took her face from her hands.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she said quietly, \'93that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke!\'94 She\
flung her head up proudly. \'93_This_ is Evelyn Howard! And she is on the\
side of Justice! Let the cost be what it may.\'94 And with these words,\
she walked firmly out of the room.\
\
\'93There,\'94 said Poirot, looking after her, \'93goes a very valuable ally.\
That woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart.\'94\
\
I did not reply.\
\
\'93Instinct is a marvellous thing,\'94 mused Poirot. \'93It can neither be\
explained nor ignored.\'94\
\
\'93You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about,\'94 I\
observed coldly. \'93Perhaps you don\'92t realize that _I_ am still in the\
dark.\'94\
\
\'93Really? Is that so, _mon ami?_\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Enlighten me, will you?\'94\
\
Poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two. Then, to my intense\
surprise, he shook his head decidedly.\
\
\'93No, my friend.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, look here, why not?\'94\
\
\'93Two is enough for a secret.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me.\'94\
\
\'93I am not keeping back facts. Every fact that I know is in your\
possession. You can draw your own deductions from them. This time it is\
a question of ideas.\'94\
\
\'93Still, it would be interesting to know.\'94\
\
Poirot looked at me very earnestly, and again shook his head.\
\
\'93You see,\'94 he said sadly, \'93_you_ have no instincts.\'94\
\
\'93It was intelligence you were requiring just now,\'94 I pointed out.\
\
\'93The two often go together,\'94 said Poirot enigmatically.\
\
The remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the\
trouble to answer it. But I decided that if I made any interesting and\
important discoveries\'97as no doubt I should\'97I would keep them to myself,\
and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.\
\
There are times when it is one\'92s duty to assert oneself.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX. DR. BAUERSTEIN\
\
I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot\'92s message to\
Lawrence. But now, as I strolled out on the lawn, still nursing a\
grudge against my friend\'92s high-handedness, I saw Lawrence on the\
croquet lawn, aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about,\
with a still more ancient mallet.\
\
It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message.\
Otherwise, Poirot himself might relieve me of it. It was true that I\
did not quite gather its purport, but I flattered myself that by\
Lawrence\'92s reply, and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my\
part, I should soon perceive its significance. Accordingly I accosted\
him.\
\
\'93I\'92ve been looking for you,\'94 I remarked untruthfully.\
\
\'93Have you?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. The truth is, I\'92ve got a message for you\'97from Poirot.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93He told me to wait until I was alone with you,\'94 I said, dropping my\
voice significantly, and watching him intently out of the corner of my\
eye. I have always been rather good at what is called, I believe,\
creating an atmosphere.\
\
\'93Well?\'94\
\
There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face. Had he\
any idea of what I was about to say?\
\
\'93This is the message.\'94 I dropped my voice still lower. \'93\'91Find the extra\
coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\'92\'94\
\
\'93What on earth does he mean?\'94 Lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected\
astonishment.\
\
\'93Don\'92t you know?\'94\
\
\'93Not in the least. Do you?\'94\
\
I was compelled to shake my head.\
\
\'93What extra coffee-cup?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know.\'94\
\
\'93He\'92d better ask Dorcas, or one of the maids, if he wants to know about\
coffee-cups. It\'92s their business, not mine. I don\'92t know anything about\
the coffee-cups, except that we\'92ve got some that are never used, which\
are a perfect dream! Old Worcester. You\'92re not a connoisseur, are you,\
Hastings?\'94\
\
I shook my head.\
\
\'93You miss a lot. A really perfect bit of old china\'97it\'92s pure delight to\
handle it, or even to look at it.\'94\
\
\'93Well, what am I to tell Poirot?\'94\
\
\'93Tell him I don\'92t know what he\'92s talking about. It\'92s double Dutch to\
me.\'94\
\
\'93All right.\'94\
\
I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me\
back.\
\
\'93I say, what was the end of that message? Say it over again, will you?\'94\
\
\'93\'91Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.\'92 Are you sure\
you don\'92t know what it means?\'94 I asked him earnestly.\
\
He shook his head.\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said musingly, \'93I don\'92t. I\'97I wish I did.\'94\
\
The boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.\
Poirot had been asked by John to remain to lunch, and was already\
seated at the table.\
\
By tacit consent, all mention of the tragedy was barred. We conversed\
on the war, and other outside topics. But after the cheese and biscuits\
had been handed round, and Dorcas had left the room, Poirot suddenly\
leant forward to Mrs. Cavendish.\
\
\'93Pardon me, madame, for recalling unpleasant memories, but I have a\
little idea\'94\'97Poirot\'92s \'93little ideas\'94 were becoming a perfect\
byword\'97\'93and would like to ask one or two questions.\'94\
\
\'93Of me? Certainly.\'94\
\
\'93You are too amiable, madame. What I want to ask is this: the door\
leading into Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia,\
it was bolted, you say?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly it was bolted,\'94 replied Mary Cavendish, rather surprised. \'93I\
said so at the inquest.\'94\
\
\'93Bolted?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94 She looked perplexed.\
\
\'93I mean,\'94 explained Poirot, \'93you are sure it was bolted, and not merely\
locked?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, I see what you mean. No, I don\'92t know. I said bolted, meaning that\
it was fastened, and I could not open it, but I believe all the doors\
were found bolted on the inside.\'94\
\
\'93Still, as far as you are concerned, the door might equally well have\
been locked?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes.\'94\
\
\'93You yourself did not happen to notice, madame, when you entered Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s room, whether that door was bolted or not?\'94\
\
\'93I\'97I believe it was.\'94\
\
\'93But you did not see it?\'94\
\
\'93No. I\'97never looked.\'94\
\
\'93But _I_ did,\'94 interrupted Lawrence suddenly. \'93I happened to notice\
that it _was_ bolted.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, that settles it.\'94 And Poirot looked crestfallen.\
\
I could not help rejoicing that, for once, one of his \'93little ideas\'94\
had come to naught.\
\
After lunch Poirot begged me to accompany him home. I consented rather\
stiffly.\
\
\'93You are annoyed, is it not so?\'94 he asked anxiously, as we walked\
through the park.\
\
\'93Not at all,\'94 I said coldly.\
\
\'93That is well. That lifts a great load from my mind.\'94\
\
This was not quite what I had intended. I had hoped that he would have\
observed the stiffness of my manner. Still, the fervour of his words\
went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure. I thawed.\
\
\'93I gave Lawrence your message,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93And what did he say? He was entirely puzzled?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant.\'94\
\
I had expected Poirot to be disappointed; but, to my surprise, he\
replied that that was as he had thought, and that he was very glad. My\
pride forbade me to ask any questions.\
\
Poirot switched off on another tack.\
\
\'93Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to-day? How was that?\'94\
\
\'93She is at the hospital again. She resumed work to-day.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, she is an industrious little demoiselle. And pretty too. She is\
like pictures I have seen in Italy. I would rather like to see that\
dispensary of hers. Do you think she would show it to me?\'94\
\
\'93I am sure she would be delighted. It\'92s an interesting little place.\'94\
\
\'93Does she go there every day?\'94\
\
\'93She has all Wednesdays off, and comes back to lunch on Saturdays.\
Those are her only times off.\'94\
\
\'93I will remember. Women are doing great work nowadays, and Mademoiselle\
Cynthia is clever\'97oh, yes, she has brains, that little one.\'94\
\
\'93Yes. I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam.\'94\
\
\'93Without doubt. After all, it is very responsible work. I suppose they\
have very strong poisons there?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, she showed them to us. They are kept locked up in a little\
cupboard. I believe they have to be very careful. They always take out\
the key before leaving the room.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed. It is near the window, this cupboard?\'94\
\
\'93No, right the other side of the room. Why?\'94\
\
Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\
\
\'93I wondered. That is all. Will you come in?\'94\
\
We had reached the cottage.\
\
\'93No. I think I\'92ll be getting back. I shall go round the long way\
through the woods.\'94\
\
The woods round Styles were very beautiful. After the walk across the\
open park, it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades.\
There was hardly a breath of wind, the very chirp of the birds was\
faint and subdued. I strolled on a little way, and finally flung myself\
down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree. My thoughts of mankind were\
kindly and charitable. I even forgave Poirot for his absurd secrecy. In\
fact, I was at peace with the world. Then I yawned.\
\
I thought about the crime, and it struck me as being very unreal and\
far off.\
\
I yawned again.\
\
Probably, I thought, it really never happened. Of course, it was all a\
bad dream. The truth of the matter was that it was Lawrence who had\
murdered Alfred Inglethorp with a croquet mallet. But it was absurd of\
John to make such a fuss about it, and to go shouting out: \'93I tell you\
I won\'92t have it!\'94\
\
I woke up with a start.\
\
At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament. For, about\
twelve feet away from me, John and Mary Cavendish were standing facing\
each other, and they were evidently quarrelling. And, quite as\
evidently, they were unaware of my vicinity, for before I could move or\
speak John repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream.\
\
\'93I tell you, Mary, I won\'92t have it.\'94\
\
Mary\'92s voice came, cool and liquid:\
\
\'93Have _you_ any right to criticize my actions?\'94\
\
\'93It will be the talk of the village! My mother was only buried on\
Saturday, and here you are gadding about with the fellow.\'94\
\
\'93Oh,\'94 she shrugged her shoulders, \'93if it is only village gossip that\
you mind!\'94\
\
\'93But it isn\'92t. I\'92ve had enough of the fellow hanging about. He\'92s a\
Polish Jew, anyway.\'94\
\
\'93A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing. It leavens the\'94\'97she looked\
at him\'97\'93stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman.\'94\
\
Fire in her eyes, ice in her voice. I did not wonder that the blood\
rose to John\'92s face in a crimson tide.\
\
\'93Mary!\'94\
\
\'93Well?\'94 Her tone did not change.\
\
The pleading died out of his voice.\
\
\'93Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my\
express wishes?\'94\
\
\'93If I choose.\'94\
\
\'93You defy me?\'94\
\
\'93No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions. Have _you_ no\
friends of whom I should disapprove?\'94\
\
John fell back a pace. The colour ebbed slowly from his face.\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94 he said, in an unsteady voice.\
\
\'93You see!\'94 said Mary quietly. \'93You _do_ see, don\'92t you, that _you_ have\
no right to dictate to _me_ as to the choice of my friends?\'94\
\
John glanced at her pleadingly, a stricken look on his face.\
\
\'93No right? Have I _no_ right, Mary?\'94 he said unsteadily. He stretched\
out his hands. \'93Mary\'97\'97\'94\
\
For a moment, I thought she wavered. A softer expression came over her\
face, then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away.\
\
\'93None!\'94\
\
She was walking away when John sprang after her, and caught her by the\
arm.\
\
\'93Mary\'94\'97his voice was very quiet now\'97\'93are you in love with this fellow\
Bauerstein?\'94\
\
She hesitated, and suddenly there swept across her face a strange\
expression, old as the hills, yet with something eternally young about\
it. So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled.\
\
She freed herself quietly from his arm, and spoke over her shoulder.\
\
\'93Perhaps,\'94 she said; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade,\
leaving John standing there as though he had been turned to stone.\
\
Rather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, crackling some dead branches\
with my feet as I did so. John turned. Luckily, he took it for granted\
that I had only just come upon the scene.\
\
\'93Hullo, Hastings. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his\
cottage? Quaint little chap! Is he any good, though, really?\'94\
\
\'93He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, well, I suppose there must be something in it, then. What a rotten\
world it is, though!\'94\
\
\'93You find it so?\'94 I asked.\
\
\'93Good Lord, yes! There\'92s this terrible business to start with. Scotland\
Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box! Never know\
where they won\'92t turn up next. Screaming headlines in every paper in\
the country\'97damn all journalists, I say! Do you know there was a whole\
crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning. Sort of Madame\
Tussaud\'92s chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing.\
Pretty thick, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93Cheer up, John!\'94 I said soothingly. \'93It can\'92t last for ever.\'94\
\
\'93Can\'92t it, though? It can last long enough for us never to be able to\
hold up our heads again.\'94\
\
\'93No, no, you\'92re getting morbid on the subject.\'94\
\
\'93Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and\
stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes! But there\'92s\
worse than that.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
John lowered his voice:\
\
\'93Have you ever thought, Hastings\'97it\'92s a nightmare to me\'97who did it? I\
can\'92t help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident.\
Because\'97because\'97who could have done it? Now Inglethorp\'92s out of the\
way, there\'92s no one else; no one, I mean, except\'97one of us.\'94\
\
Yes, indeed, that was nightmare enough for any man! One of us? Yes,\
surely it must be so, unless\'97\'97-\
\
A new idea suggested itself to my mind. Rapidly, I considered it. The\
light increased. Poirot\'92s mysterious doings, his hints\'97they all fitted\
in. Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before, and\
what a relief for us all.\
\
\'93No, John,\'94 I said, \'93it isn\'92t one of us. How could it be?\'94\
\
\'93I know, but, still, who else is there?\'94\
\
\'93Can\'92t you guess?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
I looked cautiously round, and lowered my voice.\
\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein!\'94 I whispered.\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94\
\
\'93Not at all.\'94\
\
\'93But what earthly interest could he have in my mother\'92s death?\'94\
\
\'93That I don\'92t see,\'94 I confessed, \'93but I\'92ll tell you this: Poirot thinks\
so.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot? Does he? How do you know?\'94\
\
I told him of Poirot\'92s intense excitement on hearing that Dr.\
Bauerstein had been at Styles on the fatal night, and added:\
\
\'93He said twice: \'91That alters everything.\'92 And I\'92ve been thinking. You\
know Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall? Well, it\
was just then that Bauerstein arrived. Isn\'92t it possible that, as\
Inglethorp brought him through the hall, the doctor dropped something\
into the coffee in passing?\'94\
\
\'93H\'92m,\'94 said John. \'93It would have been very risky.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but it was possible.\'94\
\
\'93And then, how could he know it was her coffee? No, old fellow, I don\'92t\
think that will wash.\'94\
\
But I had remembered something else.\
\
\'93You\'92re quite right. That wasn\'92t how it was done. Listen.\'94 And I then\
told him of the cocoa sample which Poirot had taken to be analysed.\
\
John interrupted just as I had done.\
\
\'93But, look here, Bauerstein had had it analysed already?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, yes, that\'92s the point. I didn\'92t see it either until now. Don\'92t\
you understand? Bauerstein had it analysed\'97that\'92s just it! If\
Bauerstein\'92s the murderer, nothing could be simpler than for him to\
substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample, and send that to be\
tested. And of course they would find no strychnine! But no one would\
dream of suspecting Bauerstein, or think of taking another\
sample\'97except Poirot,\'94 I added, with belated recognition.\
\
\'93Yes, but what about the bitter taste that cocoa won\'92t disguise?\'94\
\
\'93Well, we\'92ve only his word for that. And there are other possibilities.\
He\'92s admittedly one of the world\'92s greatest toxicologists\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93One of the world\'92s greatest what? Say it again.\'94\
\
\'93He knows more about poisons than almost anybody,\'94 I explained. \'93Well,\
my idea is, that perhaps he\'92s found some way of making strychnine\
tasteless. Or it may not have been strychnine at all, but some obscure\
drug no one has ever heard of, which produces much the same symptoms.\'94\
\
\'93H\'92m, yes, that might be,\'94 said John. \'93But look here, how could he have\
got at the cocoa? That wasn\'92t downstairs?\'94\
\
\'93No, it wasn\'92t,\'94 I admitted reluctantly.\
\
And then, suddenly, a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind. I\
hoped and prayed it would not occur to John also. I glanced sideways at\
him. He was frowning perplexedly, and I drew a deep breath of relief,\
for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this: that\
Dr. Bauerstein might have had an accomplice.\
\
Yet surely it could not be! Surely no woman as beautiful as Mary\
Cavendish could be a murderess. Yet beautiful women had been known to\
poison.\
\
And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of\
my arrival, and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a\
woman\'92s weapon. How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday\
evening! Had Mrs. Inglethorp discovered something between her and\
Bauerstein, and threatened to tell her husband? Was it to stop that\
denunciation that the crime had been committed?\
\
Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between Poirot and\
Evelyn Howard. Was this what they had meant? Was this the monstrous\
possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe?\
\
Yes, it all fitted in.\
\
No wonder Miss Howard had suggested \'93hushing it up.\'94 Now I understood\
that unfinished sentence of hers: \'93Emily herself\'97\'97\'94 And in my heart I\
agreed with her. Would not Mrs. Inglethorp have preferred to go\
unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name\
of Cavendish.\
\
\'93There\'92s another thing,\'94 said John suddenly, and the unexpected sound\
of his voice made me start guiltily. \'93Something which makes me doubt if\
what you say can be true.\'94\
\
\'93What\'92s that?\'94 I asked, thankful that he had gone away from the subject\
of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa.\
\
\'93Why, the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post-mortem. He needn\'92t have\
done so. Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at\
heart disease.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 I said doubtfully. \'93But we don\'92t know. Perhaps he thought it\
safer in the long run. Someone might have talked afterwards. Then the\
Home Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole thing would have\
come out, then, and he would have been in an awkward position, for no\
one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been\
deceived into calling it heart disease.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that\'92s possible,\'94 admitted John. \'93Still,\'94 he added, \'93I\'92m blest if\
I can see what his motive could have been.\'94\
\
I trembled.\
\
\'93Look here,\'94 I said, \'93I may be altogether wrong. And, remember, all\
this is in confidence.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, of course\'97that goes without saying.\'94\
\
We had walked, as we talked, and now we passed through the little gate\
into the garden. Voices rose near at hand, for tea was spread out under\
the sycamore-tree, as it had been on the day of my arrival.\
\
Cynthia was back from the hospital, and I placed my chair beside her,\
and told her of Poirot\'92s wish to visit the dispensary.\
\
\'93Of course! I\'92d love him to see it. He\'92d better come to tea there one\
day. I must fix it up with him. He\'92s such a dear little man! But he\
_is_ funny. He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day, and\
put it in again, because he said it wasn\'92t straight.\'94\
\
I laughed.\
\
\'93It\'92s quite a mania with him.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
We were silent for a minute or two, and then, glancing in the direction\
of Mary Cavendish, and dropping her voice, Cynthia said:\
\
\'93Mr. Hastings.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93After tea, I want to talk to you.\'94\
\
Her glance at Mary had set me thinking. I fancied that between these\
two there existed very little sympathy. For the first time, it occurred\
to me to wonder about the girl\'92s future. Mrs. Inglethorp had made no\
provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would\
probably insist on her making her home with them\'97at any rate until the\
end of the war. John, I knew, was very fond of her, and would be sorry\
to let her go.\
\
John, who had gone into the house, now reappeared. His good-natured\
face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger.\
\
\'93Confound those detectives! I can\'92t think what they\'92re after! They\'92ve\
been in every room in the house\'97turning things inside out, and upside\
down. It really is too bad! I suppose they took advantage of our all\
being out. I shall go for that fellow Japp, when I next see him!\'94\
\
\'93Lot of Paul Prys,\'94 grunted Miss Howard.\
\
Lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something.\
\
Mary Cavendish said nothing.\
\
After tea, I invited Cynthia to come for a walk, and we sauntered off\
into the woods together.\
\
\'93Well?\'94 I inquired, as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by\
the leafy screen.\
\
With a sigh, Cynthia flung herself down, and tossed off her hat. The\
sunlight, piercing through the branches, turned the auburn of her hair\
to quivering gold.\
\
\'93Mr. Hastings\'97you are always so kind, and you know such a lot.\'94\
\
It struck me at this moment that Cynthia was really a very charming\
girl! Much more charming than Mary, who never said things of that kind.\
\
\'93Well?\'94 I asked benignantly, as she hesitated.\
\
\'93I want to ask your advice. What shall I do?\'94\
\
\'93Do?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. You see, Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for. I\
suppose she forgot, or didn\'92t think she was likely to die\'97anyway, I am\
_not_ provided for! And I don\'92t know what to do. Do you think I ought\
to go away from here at once?\'94\
\
\'93Good heavens, no! They don\'92t want to part with you, I\'92m sure.\'94\
\
Cynthia hesitated a moment, plucking up the grass with her tiny hands.\
Then she said: \'93Mrs. Cavendish does. She hates me.\'94\
\
\'93Hates you?\'94 I cried, astonished.\
\
Cynthia nodded.\
\
\'93Yes. I don\'92t know why, but she can\'92t bear me; and _he_ can\'92t, either.\'94\
\
\'93There I know you\'92re wrong,\'94 I said warmly. \'93On the contrary, John is\
very fond of you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes\'97_John_. I meant Lawrence. Not, of course, that I care whether\
Lawrence hates me or not. Still, it\'92s rather horrid when no one loves\
you, isn\'92t it?\'94\
\
\'93But they do, Cynthia dear,\'94 I said earnestly. \'93I\'92m sure you are\
mistaken. Look, there is John\'97and Miss Howard\'97\'97\'94\
\
Cynthia nodded rather gloomily. \'93Yes, John likes me, I think, and of\
course Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn\'92t be unkind to a fly. But\
Lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it, and Mary can hardly\
bring herself to be civil to me. She wants Evie to stay on, is begging\
her to, but she doesn\'92t want me, and\'97and\'97I don\'92t know what to do.\'94\
Suddenly the poor child burst out crying.\
\
I don\'92t know what possessed me. Her beauty, perhaps, as she sat there,\
with the sunlight glinting down on her head; perhaps the sense of\
relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no\
connection with the tragedy; perhaps honest pity for her youth and\
loneliness. Anyway, I leant forward, and taking her little hand, I said\
awkwardly:\
\
\'93Marry me, Cynthia.\'94\
\
Unwittingly, I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears. She sat\
up at once, drew her hand away, and said, with some asperity:\
\
\'93Don\'92t be silly!\'94\
\
I was a little annoyed.\
\
\'93I\'92m not being silly. I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming\
my wife.\'94\
\
To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a\
\'93funny dear.\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s perfectly sweet of you,\'94 she said, \'93but you know you don\'92t want\
to!\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I do. I\'92ve got\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Never mind what you\'92ve got. You don\'92t really want to\'97and I don\'92t\
either.\'94\
\
\'93Well, of course, that settles it,\'94 I said stiffly. \'93But I don\'92t see\
anything to laugh at. There\'92s nothing funny about a proposal.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed,\'94 said Cynthia. \'93Somebody might accept you next time.\
Good-bye, you\'92ve cheered me up _very_ much.\'94\
\
And, with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment, she vanished\
through the trees.\
\
Thinking over the interview, it struck me as being profoundly\
unsatisfactory.\
\
It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village, and\
look up Bauerstein. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow.\
At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might\
have as to his being suspected. I remembered how Poirot had relied on\
my diplomacy. Accordingly, I went to the little house with the\
\'93Apartments\'94 card inserted in the window, where I knew he lodged, and\
tapped on the door.\
\
An old woman came and opened it.\
\
\'93Good afternoon,\'94 I said pleasantly. \'93Is Dr. Bauerstein in?\'94\
\
She stared at me.\
\
\'93Haven\'92t you heard?\'94\
\
\'93Heard what?\'94\
\
\'93About him.\'94\
\
\'93What about him?\'94\
\
\'93He\'92s took.\'94\
\
\'93Took? Dead?\'94\
\
\'93No, took by the perlice.\'94\
\
\'93By the police!\'94 I gasped. \'93Do you mean they\'92ve arrested him?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that\'92s it, and\'97\'97\'94\
\
I waited to hear no more, but tore up the village to find Poirot.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X. THE ARREST\
\
To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who\
answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.\
\
I was dumbfounded. What on earth could Poirot be doing in London! Was\
it a sudden decision on his part, or had he already made up his mind\
when he parted from me a few hours earlier?\
\
I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance. With Poirot away, I\
was uncertain how to act. Had he foreseen this arrest? Had he not, in\
all probability, been the cause of it? Those questions I could not\
resolve. But in the meantime what was I to do? Should I announce the\
arrest openly at Styles, or not? Though I did not acknowledge it to\
myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me. Would it not\
be a terrible shock to her? For the moment, I set aside utterly any\
suspicions of her. She could not be implicated\'97otherwise I should have\
heard some hint of it.\
\
Of course, there was no possibility of being able permanently to\
conceal Dr. Bauerstein\'92s arrest from her. It would be announced in\
every newspaper on the morrow. Still, I shrank from blurting it out. If\
only Poirot had been accessible, I could have asked his advice. What\
possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way?\
\
In spite of myself, my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably\
heightened. I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor, had not\
Poirot put it into my head. Yes, decidedly, the little man was clever.\
\
After some reflecting, I decided to take John into my confidence, and\
leave him to make the matter public or not, as he thought fit.\
\
He gave vent to a prodigious whistle, as I imparted the news.\
\
\'93Great Scott! You _were_ right, then. I couldn\'92t believe it at the\
time.\'94\
\
\'93No, it is astonishing until you get used to the idea, and see how it\
makes everything fit in. Now, what are we to do? Of course, it will be\
generally known to-morrow.\'94\
\
John reflected.\
\
\'93Never mind,\'94 he said at last, \'93we won\'92t say anything at present. There\
is no need. As you say, it will be known soon enough.\'94\
\
But to my intense surprise, on getting down early the next morning, and\
eagerly opening the newspapers, there was not a word about the arrest!\
There was a column of mere padding about \'93The Styles Poisoning Case,\'94\
but nothing further. It was rather inexplicable, but I supposed that,\
for some reason or other, Japp wished to keep it out of the papers. It\
worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there\
might be further arrests to come.\
\
After breakfast, I decided to go down to the village, and see if Poirot\
had returned yet; but, before I could start, a well-known face blocked\
one of the windows, and the well-known voice said:\
\
\'93_Bonjour, mon ami!_\'94\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I\
dragged him into the room. \'93I was never so glad to see anyone. Listen,\
I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?\'94\
\
\'93My friend,\'94 replied Poirot, \'93I do not know what you are talking\
about.\'94\
\
\'93Dr. Bauerstein\'92s arrest, of course,\'94 I answered impatiently.\
\
\'93Is Bauerstein arrested, then?\'94\
\
\'93Did you not know it?\'94\
\
\'93Not the least in the world.\'94 But, pausing a moment, he added: \'93Still,\
it does not surprise me. After all, we are only four miles from the\
coast.\'94\
\
\'93The coast?\'94 I asked, puzzled. \'93What has that got to do with it?\'94\
\
Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\
\
\'93Surely, it is obvious!\'94\
\
\'93Not to me. No doubt I am very dense, but I cannot see what the\
proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs.\
Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93Nothing at all, of course,\'94 replied Poirot, smiling. \'93But we were\
speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein.\'94\
\
\'93Well, he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 cried Poirot, in apparently lively astonishment. \'93Dr.\
Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Impossible! That would be too good a farce! Who told you that, my\
friend?\'94\
\
\'93Well, no one exactly told me,\'94 I confessed. \'93But he is arrested.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, very likely. But for espionage, _mon ami_.\'94\
\
\'93Espionage?\'94 I gasped.\
\
\'93Precisely.\'94\
\
\'93Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses,\'94 replied\
Poirot placidly.\
\
\'93But\'97but I thought you thought so too?\'94\
\
Poirot gave me one look, which conveyed a wondering pity, and his full\
sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea.\
\
\'93Do you mean to say,\'94 I asked, slowly adapting myself to the new idea,\
\'93that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy?\'94\
\
Poirot nodded.\
\
\'93Have you never suspected it?\'94\
\
\'93It never entered my head.\'94\
\
\'93It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should\
bury himself in a little village like this, and should be in the habit\
of walking about at all hours of the night, fully dressed?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I confessed, \'93I never thought of such a thing.\'94\
\
\'93He is, of course, a German by birth,\'94 said Poirot thoughtfully,\
\'93though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of\
him as anything but an Englishman. He was naturalized about fifteen\
years ago. A very clever man\'97a Jew, of course.\'94\
\
\'93The blackguard!\'94 I cried indignantly.\
\
\'93Not at all. He is, on the contrary, a patriot. Think what he stands to\
lose. I admire the man myself.\'94\
\
But I could not look at it in Poirot\'92s philosophical way.\
\
\'93And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about\
all over the country!\'94 I cried indignantly.\
\
\'93Yes. I should fancy he had found her very useful,\'94 remarked Poirot.\
\'93So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together, any\
other vagaries of the doctor\'92s passed unobserved.\'94\
\
\'93Then you think he never really cared for her?\'94 I asked eagerly\'97rather\
too eagerly, perhaps, under the circumstances.\
\
\'93That, of course, I cannot say, but\'97shall I tell you my own private\
opinion, Hastings?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Well, it is this: that Mrs. Cavendish does not care, and never has\
cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein!\'94\
\
\'93Do you really think so?\'94 I could not disguise my pleasure.\
\
\'93I am quite sure of it. And I will tell you why.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93Because she cares for someone else, _mon ami_.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 What did he mean? In spite of myself, an agreeable warmth spread\
over me. I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I\
remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time,\
perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate\'97\'97\
\
My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss\
Howard. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in\
the room, and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper. This she\
handed to Poirot, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words:\
\
\'93On top of the wardrobe.\'94 Then she hurriedly left the room.\
\
Poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly, and uttered an exclamation\
of satisfaction. He spread it out on the table.\
\
\'93Come here, Hastings. Now tell me, what is that initial\'97J. or L.?\'94\
\
It was a medium sized sheet of paper, rather dusty, as though it had\
lain by for some time. But it was the label that was attracting\
Poirot\'92s attention. At the top, it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.\
Parkson\'92s, the well-known theatrical costumiers, and it was addressed\
to \'93\'97(the debatable initial) Cavendish, Esq., Styles Court, Styles St.\
Mary, Essex.\'94\
\
\'93It might be T., or it might be L.,\'94 I said, after studying the thing\
for a minute or two. \'93It certainly isn\'92t a J.\'94\
\
\'93Good,\'94 replied Poirot, folding up the paper again. \'93I, also, am of\
your way of thinking. It is an L., depend upon it!\'94\
\
\'93Where did it come from?\'94 I asked curiously. \'93Is it important?\'94\
\
\'93Moderately so. It confirms a surmise of mine. Having deduced its\
existence, I set Miss Howard to search for it, and, as you see, she has\
been successful.\'94\
\
\'93What did she mean by \'91On the top of the wardrobe\'92?\'94\
\
\'93She meant,\'94 replied Poirot promptly, \'93that she found it on top of a\
wardrobe.\'94\
\
\'93A funny place for a piece of brown paper,\'94 I mused.\
\
\'93Not at all. The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown\
paper and cardboard boxes. I have kept them there myself. Neatly\
arranged, there is nothing to offend the eye.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I asked earnestly, \'93have you made up your mind about this\
crime?\'94\
\
\'93Yes\'97that is to say, I believe I know how it was committed.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94\
\
\'93Unfortunately, I have no proof beyond my surmise, unless\'97\'97\'94 With\
sudden energy, he caught me by the arm, and whirled me down the hall,\
calling out in French in his excitement: \'93Mademoiselle Dorcas,\
Mademoiselle Dorcas, _un moment, s\'92il vous pla\'eet!_\'94\
\
Dorcas, quite flurried by the noise, came hurrying out of the pantry.\
\
\'93My good Dorcas, I have an idea\'97a little idea\'97if it should prove\
justified, what magnificent chance! Tell me, on Monday, not Tuesday,\
Dorcas, but Monday, the day before the tragedy, did anything go wrong\
with Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s bell?\'94\
\
Dorcas looked very surprised.\
\
\'93Yes, sir, now you mention it, it did; though I don\'92t know how you came\
to hear of it. A mouse, or some such, must have nibbled the wire\
through. The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning.\'94\
\
With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy, Poirot led the way back to\
the morning-room.\
\
\'93See you, one should not ask for outside proof\'97no, reason should be\
enough. But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on\
the right track. Ah, my friend, I am like a giant refreshed. I run! I\
leap!\'94\
\
And, in very truth, run and leap he did, gambolling wildly down the\
stretch of lawn outside the long window.\
\
\'93What is your remarkable little friend doing?\'94 asked a voice behind me,\
and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow. She smiled, and so did\
I. \'93What is it all about?\'94\
\
\'93Really, I can\'92t tell you. He asked Dorcas some question about a bell,\
and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as\
you see!\'94\
\
Mary laughed.\
\
\'93How ridiculous! He\'92s going out of the gate. Isn\'92t he coming back\
to-day?\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t know. I\'92ve given up trying to guess what he\'92ll do next.\'94\
\
\'93Is he quite mad, Mr. Hastings?\'94\
\
\'93I honestly don\'92t know. Sometimes, I feel sure he is as mad as a\
hatter; and then, just as he is at his maddest, I find there is method\
in his madness.\'94\
\
\'93I see.\'94\
\
In spite of her laugh, Mary was looking thoughtful this morning. She\
seemed grave, almost sad.\
\
It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on\
the subject of Cynthia. I began rather tactfully, _I_ thought, but I\
had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively.\
\
\'93You are an excellent advocate, I have no doubt, Mr. Hastings, but in\
this case your talents are quite thrown away. Cynthia will run no risk\
of encountering any unkindness from me.\'94\
\
I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she hadn\'92t thought\'97\'97 But again\
she stopped me, and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove\
Cynthia, and her troubles, out of my mind.\
\
\'93Mr. Hastings,\'94 she said, \'93do you think I and my husband are happy\
together?\'94\
\
I was considerably taken aback, and murmured something about it\'92s not\
being my business to think anything of the sort.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 she said quietly, \'93whether it is your business or not, I will\
tell you that we are _not_ happy.\'94\
\
I said nothing, for I saw that she had not finished.\
\
She began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent,\
and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked. She\
stopped suddenly, and looked up at me.\
\
\'93You don\'92t know anything about me, do you?\'94 she asked. \'93Where I come\
from, who I was before I married John\'97anything, in fact? Well, I will\
tell you. I will make a father confessor of you. You are kind, I\
think\'97yes, I am sure you are kind.\'94\
\
Somehow, I was not quite as elated as I might have been. I remembered\
that Cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way. Besides, a\
father confessor should be elderly, it is not at all the role for a\
young man.\
\
\'93My father was English,\'94 said Mrs. Cavendish, \'93but my mother was a\
Russian.\'94\
\
\'93Ah,\'94 I said, \'93now I understand\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Understand what?\'94\
\
\'93A hint of something foreign\'97different\'97that there has always been about\
you.\'94\
\
\'93My mother was very beautiful, I believe. I don\'92t know, because I never\
saw her. She died when I was quite a little child. I believe there was\
some tragedy connected with her death\'97she took an overdose of some\
sleeping draught by mistake. However that may be, my father was\
broken-hearted. Shortly afterwards, he went into the Consular Service.\
Everywhere he went, I went with him. When I was twenty-three, I had\
been nearly all over the world. It was a splendid life\'97I loved it.\'94\
\
There was a smile on her face, and her head was thrown back. She seemed\
living in the memory of those old glad days.\
\
\'93Then my father died. He left me very badly off. I had to go and live\
with some old aunts in Yorkshire.\'94 She shuddered. \'93You will understand\
me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had\
been. The narrowness, the deadly monotony of it, almost drove me mad.\'94\
She paused a minute, and added in a different tone: \'93And then I met\
John Cavendish.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93You can imagine that, from my aunts\'92 point of view, it was a very good\
match for me. But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed\
with me. No, he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable\
monotony of my life.\'94\
\
I said nothing, and after a moment, she went on:\
\
\'93Don\'92t misunderstand me. I was quite honest with him. I told him, what\
was true, that I liked him very much, that I hoped to come to like him\
more, but that I was not in any way what the world calls \'91in love\'92 with\
him. He declared that that satisfied him, and so\'97we were married.\'94\
\
She waited a long time, a little frown had gathered on her forehead.\
She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days.\
\
\'93I think\'97I am sure\'97he cared for me at first. But I suppose we were not\
well matched. Almost at once, we drifted apart. He\'97it is not a pleasing\
thing for my pride, but it is the truth\'97tired of me very soon.\'94 I must\
have made some murmur of dissent, for she went on quickly: \'93Oh, yes, he\
did! Not that it matters now\'97now that we\'92ve come to the parting of the\
ways.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean?\'94\
\
She answered quietly:\
\
\'93I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles.\'94\
\
\'93You and John are not going to live here?\'94\
\
\'93John may live here, but I shall not.\'94\
\
\'93You are going to leave him?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93But why?\'94\
\
She paused a long time, and said at last:\
\
\'93Perhaps\'97because I want to be\'97free!\'94\
\
And, as she spoke, I had a sudden vision of broad spaces, virgin tracts\
of forests, untrodden lands\'97and a realization of what freedom would\
mean to such a nature as Mary Cavendish. I seemed to see her for a\
moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as\
some shy bird of the hills. A little cry broke from her lips:\
\
\'93You don\'92t know, you don\'92t know, how this hateful place has been prison\
to me!\'94\
\
\'93I understand,\'94 I said, \'93but\'97but don\'92t do anything rash.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, rash!\'94 Her voice mocked at my prudence.\
\
Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for:\
\
\'93You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?\'94\
\
An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face, blotting out all\
expression.\
\
\'93John was so kind as to break that to me this morning.\'94\
\
\'93Well, what do you think?\'94 I asked feebly.\
\
\'93Of what?\'94\
\
\'93Of the arrest?\'94\
\
\'93What should I think? Apparently he is a German spy; so the gardener\
had told John.\'94\
\
Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless. Did she\
care, or did she not?\
\
She moved away a step or two, and fingered one of the flower vases.\
\
\'93These are quite dead. I must do them again. Would you mind\
moving\'97thank you, Mr. Hastings.\'94 And she walked quietly past me out of\
the window, with a cool little nod of dismissal.\
\
No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein. No woman could act her\
part with that icy unconcern.\
\
Poirot did not make his appearance the following morning, and there was\
no sign of the Scotland Yard men.\
\
But, at lunch-time, there arrived a new piece of evidence\'97or rather\
lack of evidence. We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter, which\
Mrs. Inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death. Our\
efforts having been in vain, we had abandoned the matter, hoping that\
it might turn up of itself one day. And this is just what did happen,\
in the shape of a communication, which arrived by the second post from\
a firm of French music publishers, acknowledging Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
cheque, and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series\
of Russian folksongs. So the last hope of solving the mystery, by means\
of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s correspondence on the fatal evening, had to be\
abandoned.\
\
Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot of the new\
disappointment, but found, to my annoyance, that he was once more out.\
\
\'93Gone to London again?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, no, monsieur, he has but taken the train to Tadminster. \'91To see a\
young lady\'92s dispensary,\'92 he said.\'94\
\
\'93Silly ass!\'94 I ejaculated. \'93I told him Wednesday was the one day she\
wasn\'92t there! Well, tell him to look us up to-morrow morning, will\
you?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, monsieur.\'94\
\
But, on the following day, no sign of Poirot. I was getting angry. He\
was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion.\
\
After lunch, Lawrence drew me aside, and asked if I was going down to\
see him.\
\
\'93No, I don\'92t think I shall. He can come up here if he wants to see us.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 Lawrence looked indeterminate. Something unusually nervous and\
excited in his manner roused my curiosity.\
\
\'93What is it?\'94 I asked. \'93I could go if there\'92s anything special.\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s nothing much, but\'97well, if you are going, will you tell him\'97\'97\'94 he\
dropped his voice to a whisper\'97\'93I think I\'92ve found the extra\
coffee-cup!\'94\
\
I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of Poirot\'92s, but now my\
curiosity was aroused afresh.\
\
Lawrence would say no more, so I decided that I would descend from my\
high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.\
\
This time I was received with a smile. Monsieur Poirot was within.\
Would I mount? I mounted accordingly.\
\
Poirot was sitting by the table, his head buried in his hands. He\
sprang up at my entrance.\
\
\'93What is it?\'94 I asked solicitously. \'93You are not ill, I trust?\'94\
\
\'93No, no, not ill. But I decide an affair of great moment.\'94\
\
\'93Whether to catch the criminal or not?\'94 I asked facetiously.\
\
But, to my great surprise, Poirot nodded gravely.\
\
\'93\'91To speak or not to speak,\'92 as your so great Shakespeare says, \'91that\
is the question.\'92\'94\
\
I did not trouble to correct the quotation.\
\
\'93You are not serious, Poirot?\'94\
\
\'93I am of the most serious. For the most serious of all things hangs in\
the balance.\'94\
\
\'93And that is?\'94\
\
\'93A woman\'92s happiness, _mon ami_,\'94 he said gravely.\
\
I did not quite know what to say.\
\
\'93The moment has come,\'94 said Poirot thoughtfully, \'93and I do not know\
what to do. For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play. No one\
but I, Hercule Poirot, would attempt it!\'94 And he tapped himself proudly\
on the breast.\
\
After pausing a few minutes respectfully, so as not to spoil his\
effect, I gave him Lawrence\'92s message.\
\
\'93Aha!\'94 he cried. \'93So he has found the extra coffee-cup. That is good.\
He has more intelligence than would appear, this long-faced Monsieur\
Lawrence of yours!\'94\
\
I did not myself think very highly of Lawrence\'92s intelligence; but I\
forebore to contradict Poirot, and gently took him to task for\
forgetting my instructions as to which were Cynthia\'92s days off.\
\
\'93It is true. I have the head of a sieve. However, the other young lady\
was most kind. She was sorry for my disappointment, and showed me\
everything in the kindest way.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, well, that\'92s all right, then, and you must go to tea with Cynthia\
another day.\'94\
\
I told him about the letter.\
\
\'93I am sorry for that,\'94 he said. \'93I always had hopes of that letter. But\
no, it was not to be. This affair must all be unravelled from within.\'94\
He tapped his forehead. \'93These little grey cells. It is \'91up to them\'92\'97as\
you say over here.\'94 Then, suddenly, he asked: \'93Are you a judge of\
finger-marks, my friend?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I said, rather surprised, \'93I know that there are no two\
finger-marks alike, but that\'92s as far as my science goes.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly.\'94\
\
He unlocked a little drawer, and took out some photographs which he\
laid on the table.\
\
\'93I have numbered them, 1, 2, 3. Will you describe them to me?\'94\
\
I studied the proofs attentively.\
\
\'93All greatly magnified, I see. No. 1, I should say, are a man\'92s\
finger-prints; thumb and first finger. No. 2 are a lady\'92s; they are\
much smaller, and quite different in every way. No. 3\'94\'97I paused for\
some time\'97\'93there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks, but here,\
very distinctly, are No. 1\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93Overlapping the others?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93You recognize them beyond fail?\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes; they are identical.\'94\
\
Poirot nodded, and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up\
again.\
\
\'93I suppose,\'94 I said, \'93that as usual, you are not going to explain?\'94\
\
\'93On the contrary. No. 1 were the finger-prints of Monsieur Lawrence.\
No. 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia. They are not important. I\
merely obtained them for comparison. No. 3 is a little more\
complicated.\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
\'93It is, as you see, highly magnified. You may have noticed a sort of\
blur extending all across the picture. I will not describe to you the\
special apparatus, dusting powder, etc., which I used. It is a\
well-known process to the police, and by means of it you can obtain a\
photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of\
time. Well, my friend, you have seen the finger-marks\'97it remains to\
tell you the particular object on which they had been left.\'94\
\
\'93Go on\'97I am really excited.\'94\
\
\'93_Eh bien!_ Photo No. 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a\
tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red\
Cross Hospital at Tadminster\'97which sounds like the house that Jack\
built!\'94\
\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 I exclaimed. \'93But what were Lawrence Cavendish\'92s\
finger-marks doing on it? He never went near the poison cupboard the\
day we were there!\'94\
\
\'93Oh, yes, he did!\'94\
\
\'93Impossible! We were all together the whole time.\'94\
\
Poirot shook his head.\
\
\'93No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.\
There was a moment when you could not have been all together, or it\
would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and\
join you on the balcony.\'94\
\
\'93I\'92d forgotten that,\'94 I admitted. \'93But it was only for a moment.\'94\
\
\'93Long enough.\'94\
\
\'93Long enough for what?\'94\
\
Poirot\'92s smile became rather enigmatical.\
\
\'93Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a\
very natural interest and curiosity.\'94\
\
Our eyes met. Poirot\'92s were pleasantly vague. He got up and hummed a\
little tune. I watched him suspiciously.\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I said, \'93what was in this particular little bottle?\'94\
\
Poirot looked out of the window.\
\
\'93Hydro-chloride of strychnine,\'94 he said, over his shoulder, continuing\
to hum.\
\
\'93Good heavens!\'94 I said it quite quietly. I was not surprised. I had\
expected that answer.\
\
\'93They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little\'97only\
occasionally for pills. It is the official solution, Liq. Strychnine\
Hydro-clor. that is used in most medicines. That is why the\
finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then.\'94\
\
\'93How did you manage to take this photograph?\'94\
\
\'93I dropped my hat from the balcony,\'94 explained Poirot simply. \'93Visitors\
were not permitted below at that hour, so, in spite of my many\
apologies, Mademoiselle Cynthia\'92s colleague had to go down and fetch it\
for me.\'94\
\
\'93Then you knew what you were going to find?\'94\
\
\'93No, not at all. I merely realized that it was possible, from your\
story, for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard. The\
possibility had to be confirmed, or eliminated.\'94\
\
\'93Poirot,\'94 I said, \'93your gaiety does not deceive me. This is a very\
important discovery.\'94\
\
\'93I do not know,\'94 said Poirot. \'93But one thing does strike me. No doubt\
it has struck you too.\'94\
\
\'93What is that?\'94\
\
\'93Why, that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case.\
This is the third time we run up against it. There was strychnine in\
Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s tonic. There is the strychnine sold across the\
counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace. Now we have more strychnine,\
handled by one of the household. It is confusing; and, as you know, I\
do not like confusion.\'94\
\
Before I could reply, one of the other Belgians opened the door and\
stuck his head in.\
\
\'93There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings.\'94\
\
\'93A lady?\'94\
\
I jumped up. Poirot followed me down the narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish\
was standing in the doorway.\
\
\'93I have been visiting an old woman in the village,\'94 she explained, \'93and\
as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would\
call for you.\'94\
\
\'93Alas, madame,\'94 said Poirot, \'93I thought you had come to honour me with\
a visit!\'94\
\
\'93I will some day, if you ask me,\'94 she promised him, smiling.\
\
\'93That is well. If you should need a father confessor, madame\'94\'97she\
started ever so slightly\'97\'93remember, Papa Poirot is always at your\
service.\'94\
\
She stared at him for a few minutes, as though seeking to read some\
deeper meaning into his words. Then she turned abruptly away.\
\
\'93Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?\'94\
\
\'93Enchanted, madame.\'94\
\
All the way to Styles, Mary talked fast and feverishly. It struck me\
that in some way she was nervous of Poirot\'92s eyes.\
\
The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its\
shrewishness. Mary shivered a little, and buttoned her black sports\
coat closer. The wind through the trees made a mournful noise, like\
some great giant sighing.\
\
We walked up to the great door of Styles, and at once the knowledge\
came to us that something was wrong.\
\
Dorcas came running out to meet us. She was crying and wringing her\
hands. I was aware of other servants huddled together in the\
background, all eyes and ears.\
\
\'93Oh, m\'92am! Oh, m\'92am! I don\'92t know how to tell you\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What is it, Dorcas?\'94 I asked impatiently. \'93Tell us at once.\'94\
\
\'93It\'92s those wicked detectives. They\'92ve arrested him\'97they\'92ve arrested\
Mr. Cavendish!\'94\
\
\'93Arrested Lawrence?\'94 I gasped.\
\
I saw a strange look come into Dorcas\'92s eyes.\
\
\'93No, sir. Not Mr. Lawrence\'97Mr. John.\'94\
\
Behind me, with a wild cry, Mary Cavendish fell heavily against me, and\
as I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in Poirot\'92s eyes.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI. THE CASE FOR THE PROSECUTION\
\
The trial of John Cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place\
two months later.\
\
Of the intervening weeks I will say little, but my admiration and\
sympathy went out unfeignedly to Mary Cavendish. She ranged herself\
passionately on her husband\'92s side, scorning the mere idea of his\
guilt, and fought for him tooth and nail.\
\
I expressed my admiration to Poirot, and he nodded thoughtfully.\
\
\'93Yes, she is of those women who show at their best in adversity. It\
brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them. Her pride and her\
jealousy have\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Jealousy?\'94 I queried.\
\
\'93Yes. Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman? As\
I was saying, her pride and jealousy have been laid aside. She thinks\
of nothing but her husband, and the terrible fate that is hanging over\
him.\'94\
\
He spoke very feelingly, and I looked at him earnestly, remembering\
that last afternoon, when he had been deliberating whether or not to\
speak. With his tenderness for \'93a woman\'92s happiness,\'94 I felt glad that\
the decision had been taken out of his hands.\
\
\'93Even now,\'94 I said, \'93I can hardly believe it. You see, up to the very\
last minute, I thought it was Lawrence!\'94\
\
Poirot grinned.\
\
\'93I know you did.\'94\
\
\'93But John! My old friend John!\'94\
\
\'93Every murderer is probably somebody\'92s old friend,\'94 observed Poirot\
philosophically. \'93You cannot mix up sentiment and reason.\'94\
\
\'93I must say I think you might have given me a hint.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps, _mon ami_, I did not do so, just because he _was_ your old\
friend.\'94\
\
I was rather disconcerted by this, remembering how I had busily passed\
on to John what I believed to be Poirot\'92s views concerning Bauerstein.\
He, by the way, had been acquitted of the charge brought against him.\
Nevertheless, although he had been too clever for them this time, and\
the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him, his wings\
were pretty well clipped for the future.\
\
I asked Poirot whether he thought John would be condemned. To my\
intense surprise, he replied that, on the contrary, he was extremely\
likely to be acquitted.\
\
\'93But, Poirot\'97\'97\'94 I protested.\
\
\'93Oh, my friend, have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs.\
It is one thing to know that a man is guilty, it is quite another\
matter to prove him so. And, in this case, there is terribly little\
evidence. That is the whole trouble. I, Hercule Poirot, know, but I\
lack the last link in my chain. And unless I can find that missing\
link\'97\'97\'94 He shook his head gravely.\
\
\'93When did you first suspect John Cavendish?\'94 I asked, after a minute or\
two.\
\
\'93Did you not suspect him at all?\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed.\'94\
\
\'93Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs.\
Cavendish and her mother-in-law, and her subsequent lack of frankness\
at the inquest?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Did you not put two and two together, and reflect that if it was not\
Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife\'97and you remember,\
he strenuously denied it at the inquest\'97it must be either Lawrence or\
John. Now, if it was Lawrence, Mary Cavendish\'92s conduct was just as\
inexplicable. But if, on the other hand, it was John, the whole thing\
was explained quite naturally.\'94\
\
\'93So,\'94 I cried, a light breaking in upon me, \'93it was John who quarrelled\
with his mother that afternoon?\'94\
\
\'93Exactly.\'94\
\
\'93And you have known this all along?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly. Mrs. Cavendish\'92s behaviour could only be explained that\
way.\'94\
\
\'93And yet you say he may be acquitted?\'94\
\
Poirot shrugged his shoulders.\
\
\'93Certainly I do. At the police court proceedings, we shall hear the\
case for the prosecution, but in all probability his solicitors will\
advise him to reserve his defence. That will be sprung upon us at the\
trial. And\'97ah, by the way, I have a word of caution to give you, my\
friend. I must not appear in the case.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94\
\
\'93No. Officially, I have nothing to do with it. Until I have found that\
last link in my chain, I must remain behind the scenes. Mrs. Cavendish\
must think I am working for her husband, not against him.\'94\
\
\'93I say, that\'92s playing it a bit low down,\'94 I protested.\
\
\'93Not at all. We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man,\
and we must use any means in our power\'97otherwise he will slip through\
our fingers. That is why I have been careful to remain in the\
background. All the discoveries have been made by Japp, and Japp will\
take all the credit. If I am called upon to give evidence at all\'94\'97he\
smiled broadly\'97\'93it will probably be as a witness for the defence.\'94\
\
I could hardly believe my ears.\
\
\'93It is quite _en r\'e8gle_,\'94 continued Poirot. \'93Strangely enough, I can\
give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution.\'94\
\
\'93Which one?\'94\
\
\'93The one that relates to the destruction of the will. John Cavendish\
did not destroy that will.\'94\
\
Poirot was a true prophet. I will not go into the details of the police\
court proceedings, as it involves many tiresome repetitions. I will\
merely state baldly that John Cavendish reserved his defence, and was\
duly committed for trial.\
\
September found us all in London. Mary took a house in Kensington,\
Poirot being included in the family party.\
\
I myself had been given a job at the War Office, so was able to see\
them continually.\
\
As the weeks went by, the state of Poirot\'92s nerves grew worse and\
worse. That \'93last link\'94 he talked about was still lacking. Privately, I\
hoped it might remain so, for what happiness could there be for Mary,\
if John were not acquitted?\
\
On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old\
Bailey, charged with \'93The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp,\'94 and\
pleaded \'93Not Guilty.\'94\
\
Sir Ernest Heavywether, the famous K.C., had been engaged to defend\
him.\
\
Mr. Philips, K.C., opened the case for the Crown.\
\
The murder, he said, was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one. It\
was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and\
trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother.\
Ever since his boyhood, she had supported him. He and his wife had\
lived at Styles Court in every luxury, surrounded by her care and\
attention. She had been their kind and generous benefactress.\
\
He proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner, a profligate\
and spendthrift, had been at the end of his financial tether, and had\
also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain Mrs. Raikes, a\
neighbouring farmer\'92s wife. This having come to his stepmother\'92s ears,\
she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death, and a quarrel\
ensued, part of which was overheard. On the previous day, the prisoner\
had purchased strychnine at the village chemist\'92s shop, wearing a\
disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon\
another man\'97to wit, Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s husband, of whom he had been\
bitterly jealous. Luckily for Mr. Inglethorp, he had been able to\
produce an unimpeachable alibi.\
\
On the afternoon of July 17th, continued Counsel, immediately after the\
quarrel with her son, Mrs. Inglethorp made a new will. This will was\
found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning, but\
evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in\
favour of her husband. Deceased had already made a will in his favour\
before her marriage, but\'97and Mr. Philips wagged an expressive\
forefinger\'97the prisoner was not aware of that. What had induced the\
deceased to make a fresh will, with the old one still extant, he could\
not say. She was an old lady, and might possibly have forgotten the\
former one; or\'97this seemed to him more likely\'97she may have had an idea\
that it was revoked by her marriage, as there had been some\
conversation on the subject. Ladies were not always very well versed in\
legal knowledge. She had, about a year before, executed a will in\
favour of the prisoner. He would call evidence to show that it was the\
prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal\
night. Later in the evening, he had sought admission to her room, on\
which occasion, no doubt, he found an opportunity of destroying the\
will which, as far as he knew, would render the one in his favour\
valid.\
\
The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery, in his\
room, by Detective Inspector Japp\'97a most brilliant officer\'97of the\
identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village\
chemist\'92s to the supposed Mr. Inglethorp on the day before the murder.\
It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts\
constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner\'92s guilt.\
\
And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite\
unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.\
\
The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been\
called at the inquest, the medical evidence being again taken first.\
\
Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the\
unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two\
questions.\
\
\'93I take it, Dr. Bauerstein, that strychnine, as a drug, acts quickly?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you.\'94\
\
Mr. Mace identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him\
to \'93Mr. Inglethorp.\'94 Pressed, he admitted that he only knew Mr.\
Inglethorp by sight. He had never spoken to him. The witness was not\
cross-examined.\
\
Alfred Inglethorp was called, and denied having purchased the poison.\
He also denied having quarrelled with his wife. Various witnesses\
testified to the accuracy of these statements.\
\
The gardeners\'92 evidence, as to the witnessing of the will was taken,\
and then Dorcas was called.\
\
Dorcas, faithful to her \'93young gentlemen,\'94 denied strenuously that it\
could have been John\'92s voice she heard, and resolutely declared, in the\
teeth of everything, that it was Mr. Inglethorp who had been in the\
boudoir with her mistress. A rather wistful smile passed across the\
face of the prisoner in the dock. He knew only too well how useless her\
gallant defiance was, since it was not the object of the defence to\
deny this point. Mrs. Cavendish, of course, could not be called upon to\
give evidence against her husband.\
\
After various questions on other matters, Mr. Philips asked:\
\
\'93In the month of June last, do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr.\
Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson\'92s?\'94\
\
Dorcas shook her head.\
\
\'93I don\'92t remember, sir. It may have done, but Mr. Lawrence was away\
from home part of June.\'94\
\
\'93In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away, what\
would be done with it?\'94\
\
\'93It would either be put in his room or sent on after him.\'94\
\
\'93By you?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir, I should leave it on the hall table. It would be Miss Howard\
who would attend to anything like that.\'94\
\
Evelyn Howard was called and, after being examined on other points, was\
questioned as to the parcel.\
\
\'93Don\'92t remember. Lots of parcels come. Can\'92t remember one special one.\'94\
\
\'93You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales,\
or whether it was put in his room?\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t think it was sent after him. Should have remembered it if it\
was.\'94\
\
\'93Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish, and\
afterwards it disappeared, should you remark its absence?\'94\
\
\'93No, don\'92t think so. I should think someone had taken charge of it.\'94\
\
\'93I believe, Miss Howard, that it was you who found this sheet of brown\
paper?\'94 He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined\
in the morning-room at Styles.\
\
\'93Yes, I did.\'94\
\
\'93How did you come to look for it?\'94\
\
\'93The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search\
for it.\'94\
\
\'93Where did you eventually discover it?\'94\
\
\'93On the top of\'97of\'97a wardrobe.\'94\
\
\'93On top of the prisoner\'92s wardrobe?\'94\
\
\'93I\'97I believe so.\'94\
\
\'93Did you not find it yourself?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Then you must know where you found it?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, it was on the prisoner\'92s wardrobe.\'94\
\
\'93That is better.\'94\
\
An assistant from Parkson\'92s, Theatrical Costumiers, testified that on\
June 29th, they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L. Cavendish, as\
requested. It was ordered by letter, and a postal order was enclosed.\
No, they had not kept the letter. All transactions were entered in\
their books. They had sent the beard, as directed, to \'93L. Cavendish,\
Esq., Styles Court.\'94\
\
Sir Ernest Heavywether rose ponderously.\
\
\'93Where was the letter written from?\'94\
\
\'93From Styles Court.\'94\
\
\'93The same address to which you sent the parcel?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93And the letter came from there?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
Like a beast of prey, Heavywether fell upon him:\
\
\'93How do you know?\'94\
\
\'93I\'97I don\'92t understand.\'94\
\
\'93How do you know that letter came from Styles? Did you notice the\
postmark?\'94\
\
\'93No\'97but\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Ah, you did _not_ notice the postmark! And yet you affirm so\
confidently that it came from Styles. It might, in fact, have been any\
postmark?\'94\
\
\'93Y\'97es.\'94\
\
\'93In fact, the letter, though written on stamped notepaper, might have\
been posted from anywhere? From Wales, for instance?\'94\
\
The witness admitted that such might be the case, and Sir Ernest\
signified that he was satisfied.\
\
Elizabeth Wells, second housemaid at Styles, stated that after she had\
gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door, instead\
of leaving it on the latch as Mr. Inglethorp had requested. She had\
accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error. Hearing a\
slight noise in the West wing, she had peeped along the passage, and\
had seen Mr. John Cavendish knocking at Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s door.\
\
Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful\
bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down\
again with a satisfied smile on his face.\
\
With the evidence of Annie, as to the candle grease on the floor, and\
as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir, the\
proceedings were adjourned until the following day.\
\
As we went home, Mary Cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting\
counsel.\
\
\'93That hateful man! What a net he has drawn around my poor John! How he\
twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasn\'92t!\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I said consolingly, \'93it will be the other way about to-morrow.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 she said meditatively; then suddenly dropped her voice. \'93Mr.\
Hastings, you do not think\'97surely it could not have been Lawrence\'97Oh,\
no, that could not be!\'94\
\
But I myself was puzzled, and as soon as I was alone with Poirot I\
asked him what he thought Sir Ernest was driving at.\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 said Poirot appreciatively. \'93He is a clever man, that Sir\
Ernest.\'94\
\
\'93Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty?\'94\
\
\'93I do not think he believes or cares anything! No, what he is trying\
for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are\
divided in their opinion as to which brother did it. He is endeavouring\
to make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as\
against John\'97and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed.\'94\
\
Detective-inspector Japp was the first witness called when the trial\
was reopened, and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly. After\
relating the earlier events, he proceeded:\
\
\'93Acting on information received, Superintendent Summerhaye and myself\
searched the prisoner\'92s room, during his temporary absence from the\
house. In his chest of drawers, hidden beneath some underclothing, we\
found: first, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by\
Mr. Inglethorp\'94\'97these were exhibited\'97\'93secondly, this phial.\'94\
\
The phial was that already recognized by the chemist\'92s assistant, a\
tiny bottle of blue glass, containing a few grains of a white\
crystalline powder, and labelled: \'93Strychnine Hydro-chloride. POISON.\'94\
\
A fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police\
court proceedings was a long, almost new piece of blotting-paper. It\
had been found in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s cheque book, and on being reversed\
at a mirror, showed clearly the words: \'93. . . erything of which I die\
possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing...\'94 This placed\
beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of\
the deceased lady\'92s husband. Japp then produced the charred fragment of\
paper recovered from the grate, and this, with the discovery of the\
beard in the attic, completed his evidence.\
\
But Sir Ernest\'92s cross-examination was yet to come.\
\
\'93What day was it when you searched the prisoner\'92s room?\'94\
\
\'93Tuesday, the 24th of July.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly a week after the tragedy?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93You found these two objects, you say, in the chest of drawers. Was the\
drawer unlocked?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a\
crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone\
to find?\'94\
\
\'93He might have stowed them there in a hurry.\'94\
\
\'93But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime. He would\
have had ample time to remove them and destroy them.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps.\'94\
\
\'93There is no perhaps about it. Would he, or would he not have had\
plenty of time to remove and destroy them?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy\
or light?\'94\
\
\'93Heavyish.\'94\
\
\'93In other words, it was winter underclothing. Obviously, the prisoner\
would not be likely to go to that drawer?\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps not.\'94\
\
\'93Kindly answer my question. Would the prisoner, in the hottest week of\
a hot summer, be likely to go to a drawer containing winter\
underclothing. Yes, or no?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93In that case, is it not possible that the articles in question might\
have been put there by a third person, and that the prisoner was quite\
unaware of their presence?\'94\
\
\'93I should not think it likely.\'94\
\
\'93But it is possible?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93That is all.\'94\
\
More evidence followed. Evidence as to the financial difficulties in\
which the prisoner had found himself at the end of July. Evidence as to\
his intrigue with Mrs. Raikes\'97poor Mary, that must have been bitter\
hearing for a woman of her pride. Evelyn Howard had been right in her\
facts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to\
jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.\
\
Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box. In a low voice, in answer\
to Mr. Philips\'92 questions, he denied having ordered anything from\
Parkson\'92s in June. In fact, on June 29th, he had been staying away, in\
Wales.\
\
Instantly, Sir Ernest\'92s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward.\
\
\'93You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson\'92s on June 29th?\'94\
\
\'93I do.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! In the event of anything happening to your brother, who will\
inherit Styles Court?\'94\
\
The brutality of the question called a flush to Lawrence\'92s pale face.\
The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the\
prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.\
\
Heavywether cared nothing for his client\'92s anger.\
\
\'93Answer my question, if you please.\'94\
\
\'93I suppose,\'94 said Lawrence quietly, \'93that I should.\'94\
\
\'93What do you mean by you \'91suppose\'92? Your brother has no children. You\
_would_ inherit it, wouldn\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, that\'92s better,\'94 said Heavywether, with ferocious geniality. \'93And\
you\'92d inherit a good slice of money too, wouldn\'92t you?\'94\
\
\'93Really, Sir Ernest,\'94 protested the judge, \'93these questions are not\
relevant.\'94\
\
Sir Ernest bowed, and having shot his arrow proceeded.\
\
\'93On Tuesday, the 17th July, you went, I believe, with another guest, to\
visit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Did you\'97while you happened to be alone for a few seconds\'97unlock the\
poison cupboard, and examine some of the bottles?\'94\
\
\'93I\'97I\'97may have done so.\'94\
\
\'93I put it to you that you did do so?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
Sir Ernest fairly shot the next question at him.\
\
\'93Did you examine one bottle in particular?\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not think so.\'94\
\
\'93Be careful, Mr. Cavendish. I am referring to a little bottle of\
Hydro-chloride of Strychnine.\'94\
\
Lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour.\
\
\'93N\'97o\'97I am sure I didn\'92t.\'94\
\
\'93Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable\
impress of your finger-prints on it?\'94\
\
The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition.\
\
\'93I\'97I suppose I must have taken up the bottle.\'94\
\
\'93I suppose so too! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly not.\'94\
\
\'93Then why did you take it up?\'94\
\
\'93I once studied to be a doctor. Such things naturally interest me.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! So poisons \'91naturally interest\'92 you, do they? Still, you waited to\
be alone before gratifying that \'91interest\'92 of yours?\'94\
\
\'93That was pure chance. If the others had been there, I should have done\
just the same.\'94\
\
\'93Still, as it happens, the others were not there?\'94\
\
\'93No, but\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93In fact, during the whole afternoon, you were only alone for a couple\
of minutes, and it happened\'97I say, it happened\'97to be during those two\
minutes that you displayed your \'91natural interest\'92 in Hydro-chloride of\
Strychnine?\'94\
\
Lawrence stammered pitiably.\
\
\'93I\'97I\'97\'97\'94\
\
With a satisfied and expressive countenance, Sir Ernest observed:\
\
\'93I have nothing more to ask you, Mr. Cavendish.\'94\
\
This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court. The\
heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid\
together, and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily\
threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate\
silence.\
\
There was little more evidence. The hand-writing experts were called\
upon for their opinion of the signature of \'93Alfred Inglethorp\'94 in the\
chemist\'92s poison register. They all declared unanimously that it was\
certainly not his hand-writing, and gave it as their view that it might\
be that of the prisoner disguised. Cross-examined, they admitted that\
it might be the prisoner\'92s hand-writing cleverly counterfeited.\
\
Sir Ernest Heavywether\'92s speech in opening the case for the defence was\
not a long one, but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic\
manner. Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he\
known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence. Not only was it\
entirely circumstantial, but the greater part of it was practically\
unproved. Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it\
impartially. The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the\
prisoner\'92s room. That drawer was an unlocked one, as he had pointed\
out, and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was\
the prisoner who had concealed the poison there. It was, in fact, a\
wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix\
the crime on the prisoner. The prosecution had been unable to produce a\
shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the\
prisoner who ordered the black beard from Parkson\'92s. The quarrel which\
had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely\
admitted, but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly\
exaggerated.\
\
His learned friend\'97Sir Ernest nodded carelessly at Mr. Philips\'97had\
stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man, he would have come\
forward at the inquest to explain that it was he, and not Mr.\
Inglethorp, who had been the participator in the quarrel. He thought\
the facts had been misrepresented. What had actually occurred was this.\
The prisoner, returning to the house on Tuesday evening, had been\
authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr.\
and Mrs. Inglethorp. No suspicion had entered the prisoner\'92s head that\
anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of Mr.\
Inglethorp. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two\
quarrels.\
\
The prosecution averred that on Monday, July 16th, the prisoner had\
entered the chemist\'92s shop in the village, disguised as Mr. Inglethorp.\
The prisoner, on the contrary, was at that time at a lonely spot called\
Marston\'92s Spinney, where he had been summoned by an anonymous note,\
couched in blackmailing terms, and threatening to reveal certain\
matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands. The prisoner\
had, accordingly, gone to the appointed spot, and after waiting there\
vainly for half an hour had returned home. Unfortunately, he had met\
with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of\
his story, but luckily he had kept the note, and it would be produced\
as evidence.\
\
As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will, the\
prisoner had formerly practised at the Bar, and was perfectly well\
aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically\
revoked by his stepmother\'92s remarriage. He would call evidence to show\
who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up\
quite a new view of the case.\
\
Finally, he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against\
other people besides John Cavendish. He would direct their attention to\
the fact that the evidence against Mr. Lawrence Cavendish was quite as\
strong, if not stronger than that against his brother.\
\
He would now call the prisoner.\
\
John acquitted himself well in the witness-box. Under Sir Ernest\'92s\
skilful handling, he told his tale credibly and well. The anonymous\
note received by him was produced, and handed to the jury to examine.\
The readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties, and\
the disagreement with his stepmother, lent value to his denials.\
\
At the close of his examination, he paused, and said:\
\
\'93I should like to make one thing clear. I utterly reject and disapprove\
of Sir Ernest Heavywether\'92s insinuations against my brother. My\
brother, I am convinced, had no more to do with the crime than I have.\'94\
\
Sir Ernest merely smiled, and noted with a sharp eye that John\'92s\
protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury.\
\
Then the cross-examination began.\
\
\'93I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the\
witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for\
that of Mr. Inglethorp. Is not that very surprising?\'94\
\
\'93No, I don\'92t think so. I was told there had been a quarrel between my\
mother and Mr. Inglethorp, and it never occurred to me that such was\
not really the case.\'94\
\
\'93Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the\
conversation\'97fragments which you must have recognized?\'94\
\
\'93I did not recognize them.\'94\
\
\'93Your memory must be unusually short!\'94\
\
\'93No, but we were both angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I\
paid very little attention to my mother\'92s actual words.\'94\
\
Mr. Philips\'92 incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill. He\
passed on to the subject of the note.\
\
\'93You have produced this note very opportunely. Tell me, is there\
nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it?\'94\
\
\'93Not that I know of.\'94\
\
\'93Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own\
hand-writing\'97carelessly disguised?\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not think so.\'94\
\
\'93I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing!\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93I put it to you that, anxious to prove an alibi, you conceived the\
idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment, and wrote this\
note yourself in order to bear out your statement!\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93Is it not a fact that, at the time you claim to have been waiting\
about at a solitary and unfrequented spot, you were really in the\
chemist\'92s shop in Styles St. Mary, where you purchased strychnine in\
the name of Alfred Inglethorp?\'94\
\
\'93No, that is a lie.\'94\
\
\'93I put it to you that, wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp\'92s clothes, with\
a black beard trimmed to resemble his, you were there\'97and signed the\
register in his name!\'94\
\
\'93That is absolutely untrue.\'94\
\
\'93Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between\
the note, the register, and your own, to the consideration of the\
jury,\'94 said Mr. Philips, and sat down with the air of a man who has\
done his duty, but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate\
perjury.\
\
After this, as it was growing late, the case was adjourned till Monday.\
\
Poirot, I noticed, was looking profoundly discouraged. He had that\
little frown between the eyes that I knew so well.\
\
\'93What is it, Poirot?\'94 I inquired.\
\
\'93Ah, _mon ami_, things are going badly, badly.\'94\
\
In spite of myself, my heart gave a leap of relief. Evidently there was\
a likelihood of John Cavendish being acquitted.\
\
When we reached the house, my little friend waved aside Mary\'92s offer of\
tea.\
\
\'93No, I thank you, madame. I will mount to my room.\'94\
\
I followed him. Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out\
a small pack of patience cards. Then he drew up a chair to the table,\
and, to my utter amazement, began solemnly to build card houses!\
\
My jaw dropped involuntarily, and he said at once:\
\
\'93No, _mon ami_, I am not in my second childhood! I steady my nerves,\
that is all. This employment requires precision of the fingers. With\
precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain. And never have I\
needed that more than now!\'94\
\
\'93What is the trouble?\'94 I asked.\
\
With a great thump on the table, Poirot demolished his carefully built\
up edifice.\
\
\'93It is this, _mon ami!_ That I can build card houses seven stories\
high, but I cannot\'94\'97thump\'97\'93find\'94\'97thump\'97\'93 that last link of which I\
spoke to you.\'94\
\
I could not quite tell what to say, so I held my peace, and he began\
slowly building up the cards again, speaking in jerks as he did so.\
\
\'93It is done\'97so! By placing\'97one card\'97on another\'97with\
mathematical\'97precision!\'94\
\
I watched the card house rising under his hands, story by story. He\
never hesitated or faltered. It was really almost like a conjuring\
trick.\
\
\'93What a steady hand you\'92ve got,\'94 I remarked. \'93I believe I\'92ve only seen\
your hand shake once.\'94\
\
\'93On an occasion when I was enraged, without doubt,\'94 observed Poirot,\
with great placidity.\
\
\'93Yes indeed! You were in a towering rage. Do you remember? It was when\
you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
bedroom had been forced. You stood by the mantelpiece, twiddling the\
things on it in your usual fashion, and your hand shook like a leaf! I\
must say\'97\'97\'94\
\
But I stopped suddenly. For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate\
cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands\
over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the\
keenest agony.\
\
\'93Good heavens, Poirot!\'94 I cried. \'93What is the matter? Are you taken\
ill?\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94 he gasped. \'93It is\'97it is\'97that I have an idea!\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 I exclaimed, much relieved. \'93One of your \'91little ideas\'92?\'94\
\
\'93Ah, _ma foi_, no!\'94 replied Poirot frankly. \'93This time it is an idea\
gigantic! Stupendous! And you\'97_you_, my friend, have given it to me!\'94\
\
Suddenly clasping me in his arms, he kissed me warmly on both cheeks,\
and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room.\
\
Mary Cavendish entered at that moment.\
\
\'93What _is_ the matter with Monsieur Poirot? He rushed past me crying\
out: \'91A garage! For the love of Heaven, direct me to a garage, madame!\'92\
And, before I could answer, he had dashed out into the street.\'94\
\
I hurried to the window. True enough, there he was, tearing down the\
street, hatless, and gesticulating as he went. I turned to Mary with a\
gesture of despair.\
\
\'93He\'92ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute. There he goes,\
round the corner!\'94\
\
Our eyes met, and we stared helplessly at one another.\
\
\'93What can be the matter?\'94\
\
I shook my head.\
\
\'93I don\'92t know. He was building card houses, when suddenly he said he\
had an idea, and rushed off as you saw.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Mary, \'93I expect he will be back before dinner.\'94\
\
But night fell, and Poirot had not returned.\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII. THE LAST LINK\
\
Poirot\'92s abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly. Sunday morning\
wore away, and still he did not reappear. But about three o\'92clock a\
ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window, to see\
Poirot alighting from a car, accompanied by Japp and Summerhaye. The\
little man was transformed. He radiated an absurd complacency. He bowed\
with exaggerated respect to Mary Cavendish.\
\
\'93Madame, I have your permission to hold a little _r\'e9union_ in the\
_salon_? It is necessary for everyone to attend.\'94\
\
Mary smiled sadly.\
\
\'93You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have _carte blanche_ in every\
way.\'94\
\
\'93You are too amiable, madame.\'94\
\
Still beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing\
forward chairs as he did so.\
\
\'93Miss Howard\'97here. Mademoiselle Cynthia. Monsieur Lawrence. The good\
Dorcas. And Annie. _Bien!_ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes\
until Mr. Inglethorp arrives. I have sent him a note.\'94\
\
Miss Howard rose immediately from her seat.\
\
\'93If that man comes into the house, I leave it!\'94\
\
\'93No, no!\'94 Poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice.\
\
Finally Miss Howard consented to return to her chair. A few minutes\
later Alfred Inglethorp entered the room.\
\
The company once assembled, Poirot rose from his seat with the air of a\
popular lecturer, and bowed politely to his audience.\
\
\'93_Messieurs, mesdames_, as you all know, I was called in by Monsieur\
John Cavendish to investigate this case. I at once examined the bedroom\
of the deceased which, by the advice of the doctors, had been kept\
locked, and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy\
occurred. I found: first, a fragment of green material; second, a stain\
on the carpet near the window, still damp; thirdly, an empty box of\
bromide powders.\
\
\'93To take the fragment of green material first, I found it caught in the\
bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one\
occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia. I handed the fragment over to the\
police who did not consider it of much importance. Nor did they\
recognize it for what it was\'97a piece torn from a green land armlet.\'94\
\
There was a little stir of excitement.\
\
\'93Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land\'97Mrs.\
Cavendish. Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the\
deceased\'92s room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle\
Cynthia\'92s room.\'94\
\
\'93But that door was bolted on the inside!\'94 I cried.\
\
\'93When I examined the room, yes. But in the first place we have only her\
word for it, since it was she who tried that particular door and\
reported it fastened. In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample\
opportunity to shoot the bolt across. I took an early opportunity of\
verifying my conjectures. To begin with, the fragment corresponds\
exactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish\'92s armlet. Also, at the inquest,\
Mrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard, from her own room, the fall\
of the table by the bed. I took an early opportunity of testing that\
statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of\
the building, just outside Mrs. Cavendish\'92s door. I myself, in company\
with the police, went to the deceased\'92s room, and whilst there I,\
apparently accidentally, knocked over the table in question, but found\
that, as I had expected, Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all.\
This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth\
when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of\
the tragedy. In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her\
own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased\'92s room when the\
alarm was given.\'94\
\
I shot a quick glance at Mary. She was very pale, but smiling.\
\
\'93I proceeded to reason on that assumption. Mrs. Cavendish is in her\
mother-in-law\'92s room. We will say that she is seeking for something and\
has not yet found it. Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized\
with an alarming paroxysm. She flings out her arm, overturning the bed\
table, and then pulls desperately at the bell. Mrs. Cavendish,\
startled, drops her candle, scattering the grease on the carpet. She\
picks it up, and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia\'92s room,\
closing the door behind her. She hurries out into the passage, for the\
servants must not find her where she is. But it is too late! Already\
footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings.\
What can she do? Quick as thought, she hurries back to the young girl\'92s\
room, and starts shaking her awake. The hastily aroused household come\
trooping down the passage. They are all busily battering at Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s door. It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not\
arrived with the rest, but\'97and this is significant\'97I can find no one\
who saw her come from the other wing.\'94 He looked at Mary Cavendish. \'93Am\
I right, madame?\'94\
\
She bowed her head.\
\
\'93Quite right, monsieur. You understand that, if I had thought I would\
do my husband any good by revealing these facts, I would have done so.\
But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or\
innocence.\'94\
\
\'93In a sense, that is correct, madame. But it cleared my mind of many\
misconceptions, and left me free to see other facts in their true\
significance.\'94\
\
\'93The will!\'94 cried Lawrence. \'93Then it was you, Mary, who destroyed the\
will?\'94\
\
She shook her head, and Poirot shook his also.\
\
\'93No,\'94 he said quietly. \'93There is only one person who could possibly\
have destroyed that will\'97Mrs. Inglethorp herself!\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!\'94 I exclaimed. \'93She had only made it out that very\
afternoon!\'94\
\
\'93Nevertheless, _mon ami_, it was Mrs. Inglethorp. Because, in no other\
way can you account for the fact that, on one of the hottest days of\
the year, Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room.\'94\
\
I gave a gasp. What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as\
being incongruous! Poirot was continuing:\
\
\'93The temperature on that day, messieurs, was 80 degrees in the shade.\
Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire! Why? Because she wished to destroy\
something, and could think of no other way. You will remember that, in\
consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles, no waste paper\
was thrown away. There was therefore no means of destroying a thick\
document such as a will. The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in\
Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room, I leaped to the conclusion that it was to\
destroy some important document\'97possibly a will. So the discovery of\
the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me. I did not, of\
course, know at the time that the will in question had only been made\
this afternoon, and I will admit that, when I learnt that fact, I fell\
into a grievous error. I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the\
quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took\
place after, and not before the making of the will.\
\
\'93Here, as we know, I was wrong, and I was forced to abandon that idea.\
I faced the problem from a new standpoint. Now, at four o\'92clock, Dorcas\
overheard her mistress saying angrily: \'91You need not think that any\
fear of publicity, or scandal between husband and wife will deter me.\'94\
I conjectured, and conjectured rightly, that these words were\
addressed, not to her husband, but to Mr. John Cavendish. At five\
o\'92clock, an hour later, she uses almost the same words, but the\
standpoint is different. She admits to Dorcas, \'91I don\'92t know what to\
do; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing.\'92 At four\
o\'92clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself. At five\
o\'92clock she is in violent distress, and speaks of having had a great\
shock.\
\
\'93Looking at the matter psychologically, I drew one deduction which I\
was convinced was correct. The second \'91scandal\'92 she spoke of was not\
the same as the first\'97and it concerned herself!\
\
\'93Let us reconstruct. At four o\'92clock, Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her\
son, and threatens to denounce him to his wife\'97who, by the way,\
overheard the greater part of the conversation. At four-thirty, Mrs.\
Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills,\
makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.\
At five o\'92clock, Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable\
agitation, with a slip of paper\'97\'91a letter,\'92 Dorcas thinks\'97in her hand,\
and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted.\
Presumably, then, between four-thirty and five o\'92clock, something has\
occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling, since she is now\
as anxious to destroy the will, as she was before to make it. What was\
that something?\
\
\'93As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour. Nobody\
entered or left that boudoir. What then occasioned this sudden change\
of sentiment?\
\
\'93One can only guess, but I believe my guess to be correct. Mrs.\
Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\
asked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\
stood her husband\'92s desk\'97locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\
and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\
one of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\
searching for the stamps she came across something else\'97that slip of\
paper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\
for Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s eyes. On the other hand, Mrs. Cavendish believed\
that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously\
was a written proof of her own husband\'92s infidelity. She demanded it\
from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her, quite truly, that it had nothing\
to do with that matter. Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her. She thought\
that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\
very resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\
jealous of her husband. She determined to get hold of that paper at all\
costs, and in this resolution chance came to her aid. She happened to\
pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s despatch-case, which had been lost\
that morning. She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all\
important papers in this particular case.\
\
\'93Mrs. Cavendish, therefore, made her plans as only a woman driven\
desperate through jealousy could have done. Some time in the evening\
she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia\'92s room.\
Possibly she applied oil to the hinges, for I found that it opened\
quite noiselessly when I tried it. She put off her project until the\
early hours of the morning as being safer, since the servants were\
accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time. She dressed\
completely in her land kit, and made her way quietly through\
Mademoiselle Cynthia\'92s room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp.\'94\
\
He paused a moment, and Cynthia interrupted:\
\
\'93But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room?\'94\
\
\'93Not if you were drugged, mademoiselle.\'94\
\
\'93Drugged?\'94\
\
\'93_Mais, oui!_\'94\
\
\'93You remember\'94\'97he addressed us collectively again\'97\'93that through all the\
tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept. That admitted of\
two possibilities. Either her sleep was feigned\'97which I did not\
believe\'97or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means.\
\
\'93With this latter idea in my mind, I examined all the coffee-cups most\
carefully, remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought\
Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before. I took a sample from\
each cup, and had them analysed\'97with no result. I had counted the cups\
carefully, in the event of one having been removed. Six persons had\
taken coffee, and six cups were duly found. I had to confess myself\
mistaken.\
\
\'93Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight.\
Coffee had been brought in for seven persons, not six, for Dr.\
Bauerstein had been there that evening. This changed the face of the\
whole affair, for there was now one cup missing. The servants noticed\
nothing, since Annie, the housemaid, who took in the coffee, brought in\
seven cups, not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it, whereas\
Dorcas, who cleared them away the following morning, found six as\
usual\'97or strictly speaking she found five, the sixth being the one\
found broken in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s room.\
\
\'93I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.\
I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the\
cups found contained sugar, which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in\
her coffee. My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some\
\'91salt\'92 on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s room. I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa, and\
sent it to be analysed.\'94\
\
\'93But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein,\'94 said Lawrence\
quickly.\
\
\'93Not exactly. The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine\
was, or was not, present. He did not have it tested, as I did, for a\
narcotic.\'94\
\
\'93For a narcotic?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Here is the analyst\'92s report. Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe,\
but effectual, narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle\
Cynthia. And it is possible that she had a _mauvais quart d\'92heure_ in\
consequence! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly\
taken ill and dies, and immediately after she hears the word \'91Poison\'92!\
She has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was\
perfectly harmless, but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment\
she must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s death lay at her door. She\
is seized with panic, and under its influence she hurries downstairs,\
and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle\
Cynthia into a large brass vase, where it is discovered later by\
Monsieur Lawrence. The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch. Too\
many eyes are upon her. Guess at her relief when strychnine is\
mentioned, and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her\
doing.\
\
\'93We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning\
being so long in making their appearance. A narcotic taken with\
strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours.\'94\
\
Poirot paused. Mary looked up at him, the colour slowly rising in her\
face.\
\
\'93All you have said is quite true, Monsieur Poirot. It was the most\
awful hour of my life. I shall never forget it. But you are wonderful.\
I understand now\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa\
Poirot, eh? But you would not trust me.\'94\
\
\'93I see everything now,\'94 said Lawrence. \'93The drugged cocoa, taken on top\
of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly. But was the coffee poisoned, or was it not? We come to a\
little difficulty here, since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it.\'94\
\
\'93What?\'94 The cry of surprise was universal.\
\
\'93No. You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s room? There were some peculiar points about that stain. It\
was still damp, it exhaled a strong odour of coffee, and imbedded in\
the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china. What had\
happened was plain to me, for not two minutes before I had placed my\
little case on the table near the window, and the table, tilting up,\
had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot. In\
exactly the same way, Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee\
on reaching her room the night before, and the treacherous table had\
played her the same trick.\
\
\'93What happened next is mere guess work on my part, but I should say\
that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the\
table by the bed. Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she\
heated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there. Now we are faced\
with a new problem. We know the cocoa contained no strychnine. The\
coffee was never drunk. Yet the strychnine must have been administered\
between seven and nine o\'92clock that evening. What third medium was\
there\'97a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that\
it is extraordinary no one has thought of it?\'94 Poirot looked round the\
room, and then answered himself impressively. \'93Her medicine!\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her\
tonic?\'94 I cried.\
\
\'93There was no need to introduce it. It was already there\'97in the\
mixture. The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical\
strychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins. To make that clear to you, I will\
read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the\
Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster:\
\
\'93\'91The following prescription has become famous in text books:\
\
\
          Strychninae Sulph. . . . . . 1 gr.\
\
          Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi\
\
          Aqua ad. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii\
\
          Fiat Mistura\
\
\
_This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the\
strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals. A lady\
in England lost her life by taking a similar mixture: the precipitated\
strychnine collected at the bottom, and in taking the last dose she\
swallowed nearly all of it!_\
\
\'93Now there was, of course, no bromide in Dr. Wilkins\'92 prescription, but\
you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders. One\
or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine\
would effectually precipitate the strychnine, as the book describes,\
and cause it to be taken in the last dose. You will learn later that\
the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s medicine was always\
extremely careful not to shake the bottle, but to leave the sediment at\
the bottom of it undisturbed.\
\
\'93Throughout the case, there have been evidences that the tragedy was\
intended to take place on Monday evening. On that day, Mrs.\
Inglethorp\'92s bell wire was neatly cut, and on Monday evening\
Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends, so that Mrs.\
Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing, completely\
shut off from help of any kind, and would have died, in all\
probability, before medical aid could have been summoned. But in her\
hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp\
forgot to take her medicine, and the next day she lunched away from\
home, so that the last\'97and fatal\'97dose was actually taken twenty-four\
hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer; and it is owing\
to that delay that the final proof\'97the last link of the chain\'97is now in\
my hands.\'94\
\
Amid breathless excitement, he held out three thin strips of paper.\
\
\'93A letter in the murderer\'92s own hand-writing, _mes amis!_ Had it been a\
little clearer in its terms, it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp,\
warned in time, would have escaped. As it was, she realized her danger,\
but not the manner of it.\'94\
\
In the deathly silence, Poirot pieced together the slips of paper and,\
clearing his throat, read:\
\
Dearest Evelyn:\
\
    \'91You will be anxious at hearing nothing. It is all right\'97only it\
    will be to-night instead of last night. You understand. There\'92s a\
    good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way. No\
    one can possibly bring home the crime to me. That idea of yours\
    about the bromides was a stroke of genius! But we must be very\
    circumspect. A false step\'97\'97\'92\
\
\
\'93Here, my friends, the letter breaks off. Doubtless the writer was\
interrupted; but there can be no question as to his identity. We all\
know this hand-writing and\'97\'97\'94\
\
A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence.\
\
\'93You devil! How did you get it?\'94\
\
A chair was overturned. Poirot skipped nimbly aside. A quick movement\
on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.\
\
\'93_Messieurs, mesdames_,\'94 said Poirot, with a flourish, \'93let me\
introduce you to the murderer, Mr. Alfred Inglethorp!\'94\
\
\
\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII. POIROT EXPLAINS\
\
\'93Poirot, you old villain,\'94 I said, \'93I\'92ve half a mind to strangle you!\
What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done?\'94\
\
We were sitting in the library. Several hectic days lay behind us. In\
the room below, John and Mary were together once more, while Alfred\
Inglethorp and Miss Howard were in custody. Now at last, I had Poirot\
to myself, and could relieve my still burning curiosity.\
\
Poirot did not answer me for a moment, but at last he said:\
\
\'93I did not deceive you, _mon ami_. At most, I permitted you to deceive\
yourself.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but why?\'94\
\
\'93Well, it is difficult to explain. You see, my friend, you have a\
nature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that\'97_enfin_, to\
conceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the\
very first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman\
would have\'97in your so expressive idiom\'97\'91smelt a rat\'92! And then,\
_bonjour_ to our chances of catching him!\'94\
\
\'93I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for.\'94\
\
\'93My friend,\'94 besought Poirot, \'93I implore you, do not enrage yourself!\
Your help has been of the most invaluable. It is but the extremely\
beautiful nature that you have, which made me pause.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 I grumbled, a little mollified. \'93I still think you might have\
given me a hint.\'94\
\
\'93But I did, my friend. Several hints. You would not take them. Think\
now, did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty? Did I\
not, on the contrary, tell you that he would almost certainly be\
acquitted?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of\
bringing the murderer to justice? Was it not plain to you that I was\
speaking of two entirely different persons?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I said, \'93it was not plain to me!\'94\
\
\'93Then again,\'94 continued Poirot, \'93at the beginning, did I not repeat to\
you several times that I didn\'92t want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _now_?\
That should have conveyed something to you.\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
death, her husband would benefit the most. There was no getting away\
from that. When I went up to Styles with you that first day, I had no\
idea as to how the crime had been committed, but from what I knew of\
Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to\
connect him with it. When I arrived at the ch\'e2teau, I realized at once\
that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will; and there, by the\
way, you cannot complain, my friend, for I tried my best to force on\
you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, yes,\'94 I said impatiently. \'93Go on.\'94\
\
\'93Well, my friend, as I say, my views as to Mr. Inglethorp\'92s guilt were\
very much shaken. There was, in fact, so much evidence against him that\
I was inclined to believe that he had not done it.\'94\
\
\'93When did you change your mind?\'94\
\
\'93When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him, the more\
efforts he made to get himself arrested. Then, when I discovered that\
Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was\
John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter, I was quite sure.\'94\
\
\'93But why?\'94\
\
\'93Simply this. If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue\
with Mrs. Raikes, his silence was perfectly comprehensible. But, when I\
discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who\
was attracted by the farmer\'92s pretty wife, his silence bore quite a\
different interpretation. It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid\
of the scandal, as no possible scandal could attach to him. This\
attitude of his gave me furiously to think, and I was slowly forced to\
the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested. _Eh bien!_\
from that moment, I was equally determined that he should not be\
arrested.\'94\
\
\'93Wait a minute. I don\'92t see why he wished to be arrested?\'94\
\
\'93Because, _mon ami_, it is the law of your country that a man once\
acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence. Aha! but it\
was clever\'97his idea! Assuredly, he is a man of method. See here, he\
knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected, so he conceived\
the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence\
against himself. He wished to be arrested. He would then produce his\
irreproachable alibi\'97and, hey presto, he was safe for life!\'94\
\
\'93But I still don\'92t see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to\
the chemist\'92s shop?\'94\
\
Poirot stared at me in surprise.\
\
\'93Is it possible? My poor friend! You have not yet realized that it was\
Miss Howard who went to the chemist\'92s shop?\'94\
\
\'93Miss Howard?\'94\
\
\'93But, certainly. Who else? It was most easy for her. She is of a good\
height, her voice is deep and manly; moreover, remember, she and\
Inglethorp are cousins, and there is a distinct resemblance between\
them, especially in their gait and bearing. It was simplicity itself.\
They are a clever pair!\'94\
\
\'93I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was\
done,\'94 I remarked.\
\
\'93_Bon!_ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible. I am inclined to\
think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair. You remember\
her once mentioning that her father was a doctor? Possibly she\
dispensed his medicines for him, or she may have taken the idea from\
one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was\
studying for her exam. Anyway, she was familiar with the fact that the\
addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause\
the precipitation of the latter. Probably the idea came to her quite\
suddenly. Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders, which she\
occasionally took at night. What could be easier than quietly to\
dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s large sized\
bottle of medicine when it came from Coot\'92s? The risk is practically\
nil. The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later. If\
anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine, they will have\
forgotten it by that time. Miss Howard will have engineered her\
quarrel, and departed from the house. The lapse of time, and her\
absence, will defeat all suspicion. Yes, it was a clever idea! If they\
had left it alone, it is possible the crime might never have been\
brought home to them. But they were not satisfied. They tried to be too\
clever\'97and that was their undoing.\'94\
\
Poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\
\
\'93They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying\
strychnine at the village chemist\'92s, and signing the register in his\
hand-writing.\
\
\'93On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine. On\
Monday, therefore, at six o\'92clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be\
seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village. Miss\
Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs.\
Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards. At six\
o\'92clock, Miss Howard, disguised as Alfred Inglethorp, enters the\
chemist\'92s shop, with her story about a dog, obtains the strychnine, and\
writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John\'92s handwriting, which she\
had previously studied carefully.\
\
\'93But, as it will never do if John, too, can prove an alibi, she writes\
him an anonymous note\'97still copying his hand-writing\'97which takes him to\
a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see\
him.\
\
\'93So far, all goes well. Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham. Alfred\
Inglethorp returns to Styles. There is nothing that can compromise him\
in any way, since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine, which,\
after all, is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John\
Cavendish.\
\
\'93But now a hitch occurs. Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine\
that night. The broken bell, Cynthia\'92s absence\'97arranged by Inglethorp\
through his wife\'97all these are wasted. And then\'97he makes his slip.\
\
\'93Mrs. Inglethorp is out, and he sits down to write to his accomplice,\
who, he fears, may be in a panic at the non-success of their plan. It\
is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected.\
Caught in the act, and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his\
desk. He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it\
again, and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before\
he could snatch it up. So he goes out and walks in the woods, little\
dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the\
incriminating document.\
\
\'93But this, as we know, is what happened. Mrs. Inglethorp reads it, and\
becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard, though,\
unfortunately, the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to\
her mind. She knows that she is in danger\'97but is ignorant of where the\
danger lies. She decides to say nothing to her husband, but sits down\
and writes to her solicitor, asking him to come on the morrow, and she\
also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just\
made. She keeps the fatal letter.\'94\
\
\'93It was to discover that letter, then, that her husband forced the lock\
of the despatch-case?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he\
realized its importance. That letter excepted, there was absolutely\
nothing to connect him with the crime.\'94\
\
\'93There\'92s only one thing I can\'92t make out, why didn\'92t he destroy it at\
once when he got hold of it?\'94\
\
\'93Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all\'97that of keeping\
it on his own person.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t understand.\'94\
\
\'93Look at it from his point of view. I have discovered that there were\
only five short minutes in which he could have taken it\'97the five\
minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene, for before\
that time Annie was brushing the stairs, and would have seen anyone who\
passed going to the right wing. Figure to yourself the scene! He enters\
the room, unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys\'97they\
were all much alike. He hurries to the despatch-case\'97it is locked, and\
the keys are nowhere to be seen. That is a terrible blow to him, for it\
means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had\
hoped. But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake\
of that damning piece of evidence. Quickly, he forces the lock with a\
penknife, and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking\
for.\
\
\'93But now a fresh dilemma arises: he dare not keep that piece of paper\
on him. He may be seen leaving the room\'97he may be searched. If the\
paper is found on him, it is certain doom. Probably, at this minute,\
too, he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the\
boudoir. He must act quickly. Where can he hide this terrible slip of\
paper? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case,\
are sure to be examined. There are no means of destroying it; and he\
dare not keep it. He looks round, and he sees\'97what do you think, _mon\
ami?_\'94\
\
I shook my head.\
\
\'93In a moment, he has torn the letter into long thin strips, and rolling\
them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other\
spills in the vase on the mantle-piece.\'94\
\
I uttered an exclamation.\
\
\'93No one would think of looking there,\'94 Poirot continued. \'93And he will\
be able, at his leisure, to come back and destroy this solitary piece\
of evidence against him.\'94\
\
\'93Then, all the time, it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp\'92s\
bedroom, under our very noses?\'94 I cried.\
\
Poirot nodded.\
\
\'93Yes, my friend. That is where I discovered my \'91last link,\'92 and I owe\
that very fortunate discovery to you.\'94\
\
\'93To me?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was\
straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but I don\'92t see\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93No, but I saw. Do you know, my friend, I remembered that earlier in\
the morning, when we had been there together, I had straightened all\
the objects on the mantelpiece. And, if they were already straightened,\
there would be no need to straighten them again, unless, in the\
meantime, someone else had touched them.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me,\'94 I murmured, \'93so that is the explanation of your\
extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still\
there?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, and it was a race for time.\'94\
\
\'93But I still can\'92t understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to\
leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it.\'94\
\
\'93Ah, but he had no opportunity. _I_ saw to that.\'94\
\
\'93You?\'94\
\
\'93Yes. Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my\
confidence on the subject?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Well, my friend, I saw there was just one chance. I was not sure then\
if Inglethorp was the criminal or not, but if he was I reasoned that he\
would not have the paper on him, but would have hidden it somewhere,\
and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually\
prevent his destroying it. He was already under suspicion, and by\
making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur\
detectives, who would be watching him unceasingly, and being himself\
aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy\
the document. He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving\
it in the spill vase.\'94\
\
\'93But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but Miss Howard did not know of the paper\'92s existence. In\
accordance with their prearranged plan, she never spoke to Alfred\
Inglethorp. They were supposed to be deadly enemies, and until John\
Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a\
meeting. Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp, hoping that\
sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place. But he was too\
clever to take any chances. The paper was safe where it was; since no\
one had thought of looking there in the first week, it was not likely\
they would do so afterwards. But for your lucky remark, we might never\
have been able to bring him to justice.\'94\
\
\'93I understand that now; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss\
Howard?\'94\
\
\'93When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the\
letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp.\'94\
\
\'93Why, what was there to lie about?\'94\
\
\'93You saw that letter? Do you recall its general appearance?\'94\
\
\'93Yes\'97more or less.\'94\
\
\'93You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very\
distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words. But if\
you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that\
\'91July 17th\'92 is quite different in this respect. Do you see what I\
mean?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I confessed, \'93I don\'92t.\'94\
\
\'93You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th, but on\
the 7th\'97the day after Miss Howard\'92s departure? The \'911\'92 was written in\
before the \'917\'92 to turn it into the \'9117th\'92.\'94\
\
\'93But why?\'94\
\
\'93That is exactly what I asked myself. Why does Miss Howard suppress the\
letter written on the 17th, and produce this faked one instead? Because\
she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th. Why, again? And at\
once a suspicion dawned in my mind. You will remember my saying that it\
was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth.\'94\
\
\'93And yet,\'94 I cried indignantly, \'93after that, you gave me two reasons\
why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime!\'94\
\
\'93And very good reasons too,\'94 replied Poirot. \'93For a long time they were\
a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact:\
that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins. She could not have\
committed the crime single-handed, but the reasons against that did not\
debar her from being an accomplice. And, then, there was that rather\
over-vehement hatred of hers! It concealed a very opposite emotion.\
There was, undoubtedly, a tie of passion between them long before he\
came to Styles. They had already arranged their infamous plot\'97that he\
should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady, induce her to make\
a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very\
cleverly conceived crime. If all had gone as they planned, they would\
probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim\'92s\
money.\
\
\'93They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair. While suspicion was to\
be directed against him, she would be making quiet preparations for a\
very different _d\'e9nouement_. She arrives from Middlingham with all the\
compromising items in her possession. No suspicion attaches to her. No\
notice is paid to her coming and going in the house. She hides the\
strychnine and glasses in John\'92s room. She puts the beard in the attic.\
She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered.\'94\
\
\'93I don\'92t quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John,\'94 I\
remarked. \'93It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime\
home to Lawrence.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, but that was mere chance. All the evidence against him arose out\
of pure accident. It must, in fact, have been distinctly annoying to\
the pair of schemers.\'94\
\
\'93His manner was unfortunate,\'94 I observed thoughtfully.\
\
\'93Yes. You realize, of course, what was at the back of that?\'94\
\
\'93No.\'94\
\
\'93You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of\
the crime?\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 I exclaimed, astonished. \'93Impossible!\'94\
\
\'93Not at all. I myself nearly had the same idea. It was in my mind when\
I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will. Then there were\
the bromide powders which she had made up, and her clever male\
impersonations, as Dorcas recounted them to us. There was really more\
evidence against her than anyone else.\'94\
\
\'93You are joking, Poirot!\'94\
\
\'93No. Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he\
first entered his mother\'92s room on the fatal night? It was because,\
whilst his mother lay there, obviously poisoned, he saw, over your\
shoulder, that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia\'92s room was unbolted.\'94\
\
\'93But he declared that he saw it bolted!\'94 I cried.\
\
\'93Exactly,\'94 said Poirot dryly. \'93And that was just what confirmed my\
suspicion that it was not. He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia.\'94\
\
\'93But why should he shield her?\'94\
\
\'93Because he is in love with her.\'94\
\
I laughed.\
\
\'93There, Poirot, you are quite wrong! I happen to know for a fact that,\
far from being in love with her, he positively dislikes her.\'94\
\
\'93Who told you that, _mon ami?_\'94\
\
\'93Cynthia herself.\'94\
\
\'93_La pauvre petite!_ And she was concerned?\'94\
\
\'93She said that she did not mind at all.\'94\
\
\'93Then she certainly did mind very much,\'94 remarked Poirot. \'93They are\
like that\'97_les femmes!_\'94\
\
\'93What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me,\'94 I said.\
\
\'93But why? It was most obvious. Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour\
face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his\
brother? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia\
was in love with Monsieur John. When he entered his mother\'92s room, and\
saw her obviously poisoned, he jumped to the conclusion that\
Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter. He was nearly\
driven desperate. First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his\
feet, remembering that _she_ had gone up with his mother the night\
before, and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its\
contents. Thenceforward, he strenuously, and quite uselessly, upheld\
the theory of \'91Death from natural causes\'92.\'94\
\
\'93And what about the \'91extra coffee-cup\'92?\'94\
\
\'93I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it, but\
I had to make sure. Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant;\
but, on reflection, he came to the conclusion that if he could find an\
extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion.\
And he was perfectly right.\'94\
\
\'93One thing more. What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?\'94\
\
\'93They were, of course, an accusation against her husband.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me, Poirot,\'94 I said with a sigh, \'93I think you have explained\
everything. I am glad it has all ended so happily. Even John and his\
wife are reconciled.\'94\
\
\'93Thanks to me.\'94\
\
\'93How do you mean\'97thanks to you?\'94\
\
\'93My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the\
trial which has brought them together again? That John Cavendish still\
loved his wife, I was convinced. Also, that she was equally in love\
with him. But they had drifted very far apart. It all arose from a\
misunderstanding. She married him without love. He knew it. He is a\
sensitive man in his way, he would not force himself upon her if she\
did not want him. And, as he withdrew, her love awoke. But they are\
both unusually proud, and their pride held them inexorably apart. He\
drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes, and she deliberately\
cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein. Do you remember the day of\
John Cavendish\'92s arrest, when you found me deliberating over a big\
decision?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I quite understood your distress.\'94\
\
\'93Pardon me, _mon ami_, but you did not understand it in the least. I\
was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at\
once. I could have cleared him\'97though it might have meant a failure to\
convict the real criminals. They were entirely in the dark as to my\
real attitude up to the very last moment\'97which partly accounts for my\
success.\'94\
\
\'93Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being\
brought to trial?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, my friend. But I eventually decided in favour of \'91a woman\'92s\
happiness\'92. Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed\
could have brought these two proud souls together again.\'94\
\
I looked at Poirot in silent amazement. The colossal cheek of the\
little man! Who on earth but Poirot would have thought of a trial for\
murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness!\
\
\'93I perceive your thoughts, _mon ami_,\'94 said Poirot, smiling at me. \'93No\
one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing! And you are\
wrong in condemning it. The happiness of one man and one woman is the\
greatest thing in all the world.\'94\
\
His words took me back to earlier events. I remembered Mary as she lay\
white and exhausted on the sofa, listening, listening. There had come\
the sound of the bell below. She had started up. Poirot had opened the\
door, and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently. \'93Yes, madame,\'94\
he said. \'93I have brought him back to you.\'94 He had stood aside, and as I\
went out I had seen the look in Mary\'92s eyes, as John Cavendish had\
caught his wife in his arms.\
\
\'93Perhaps you are right, Poirot,\'94 I said gently. \'93Yes, it is the\
greatest thing in the world.\'94\
\
Suddenly, there was a tap at the door, and Cynthia peeped in.\
\
\'93I\'97I only\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Come in,\'94 I said, springing up.\
\
She came in, but did not sit down.\
\
\'93I\'97only wanted to tell you something\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Yes?\'94\
\
Cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments, then, suddenly\
exclaiming: \'93You dears!\'94 kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed\
out of the room again.\
\
\'93What on earth does this mean?\'94 I asked, surprised.\
\
It was very nice to be kissed by Cynthia, but the publicity of the\
salute rather impaired the pleasure.\
\
\'93It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike\
her as much as she thought,\'94 replied Poirot philosophically.\
\
\'93But\'97\'97\'94\
\
\'93Here he is.\'94\
\
Lawrence at that moment passed the door.\
\
\'93Eh! Monsieur Lawrence,\'94 called Poirot. \'93We must congratulate you, is\
it not so?\'94\
\
Lawrence blushed, and then smiled awkwardly. A man in love is a sorry\
spectacle. Now Cynthia had looked charming.\
\
I sighed.\
\
\'93What is it, _mon ami?_\'94\
\
\'93Nothing,\'94 I said sadly. \'93They are two delightful women!\'94\
\
\'93And neither of them is for you?\'94 finished Poirot. \'93Never mind. Console\
yourself, my friend. We may hunt together again, who knows? And then\'97\'97\'94\
\
\
\
THE END\
