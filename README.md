# The-perfect-recipe-for-murder
Analysis of AGatha Christies book

This project is part of Information Visualisation I course at NID Bengaluru.
The aim of this project is to analyse certain Agath Christia murder mysteries to understand if there is a commom plot arc which runs through them all.
Further can we develop some sort of visualisation that alllows us to identify the murderer?
